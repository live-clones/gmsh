/* APPENDIX A: mesh
 * ================
 *
 * The `HXTMesh` mesh structure is used both as input 2D mesh and as output 3D
 * mesh. It must be filled as follow for hxtTetMesh to work
 * correctly.
 *
 * NOTE: any array of size 0 can be a NULL pointer
 * SPECIAL CHARACTERS AT START OF LINE: ! # @
 *         !x <=> `x` will not be used (neither read from nor written to)
 *         @x <=> `x` should be set to 0 or NULL as input, but will contain
 *                further information when the function returns
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * mesh->vertices
 *---------------
 * mesh->vertices.num:     nb. of vertices
 * mesh->vertices.size:    capacity, in vertices, of the following array
 * mesh->vertices.coord[]: allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc(), 4 coords per point
 *                         4th coordinate is the local mesh size or 0 if the
 *                         mesh size at this point is to be interpolated. The
 *                         first `mesh->vertices.num` vertices will not be
 *                         modified by hxtTetMesh(), except for their 4th
 *                         coordinate which is used internally by hxtTetMesh().
 *                         New vertices might be added at the end of the array
 *                         by hxtTetMesh(), therefore `mesh->vertices.coord[]`
 *                         might be reallocated to another memory address.
 *
 * mesh->tetrahedra
 *---------------
 * @mesh->tetrahedra.num:     nbr. of tetrahedra
 * @mesh->tetrahedra.size:    capacity, in tetrahedra, of the following array
 * @mesh->tetrahedra.node[]:  allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc(), 4 nodes per tet
 * @mesh->tetrahedra.neigh[]: allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc() with the same
 *                            capacity as tetrahedra.node[], contains adjacency
 *                            information. More specifically:
 *                            `mesh->tetrahedra.neigh[4*t0 + i] = 4*t1 + j`
 *                            means that the facet opposite to the ith node of
 *                            tet t0 is adjacent to the the jth node of tet t1.
 *                            Therefore, we must also have:
 *                            `mesh->tetrahedra.neigh[4*t1 + j] = 4*t0 + i`
 * @mesh->tetrahedra.color:   allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc() with the same
 *                            capacity (counted in number of tet.) as
 *                            tetrahedra.node[], 1 color per tet.
 *                            The color is the ID of the volumes that contains
 *                            the tet.
 * @mesh->tetrahedra.flag:    allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc() with the same
 *                            capacity (counted in number of tet.) as
 *                            tetrahedra.node[], 1 flag per tet., see
 *                            *hxt_tetFlag.h* for more details.
 *
 * mesh->triangles
 *---------------
 * mesh->triangles.num:     nbr. of triangles
 * mesh->triangles.size:    capacity, in triangles, of the following array
 * mesh->triangles.node[]:  allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc(), 3 nodes per tri.
 * mesh->triangles.color[]: either NULL or allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc()
 *                           with same capacity (counted in number of triangles)
 *                           as triangles.node[], 1 color per triangle if !NULL
 *                           
 * mesh->lines
 *---------------
 * mesh->lines.num:    nbr. of embedded edges
 * mesh->lines.size:   capacity, in edges, of the following array
 * mesh->lines.node[]: allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc(), 2 nodes per edge,
 *                      only edges that are not on in triangles are needed
 * !mesh->lines.color[]
 *
 * mesh->points
 *---------------
 * mesh->points.num:  nbr. of embedded points
 * mesh->points.size: capacity, in points, of the following array
 * mesh->points.node: allocated with hxtAlignedMalloc(), 1 node per point,
 *                     only pts that are not in triangles or lines are needed
 * !mesh->points.color[]
 *
 * mesh->brep
 *---------------
 * mesh->brep.numVolumes:             the number of volumes to refine or 0.
 *                                    If mesh->brep.numVolumes == 0, HXT refines
 *                                    all volumes and colors them as it wants.
 *                                    In that case, it will also fill the
 *                                    mesh->brep structure accordingly.
 *                                    If mesh->brep.numVolumes != 0, the
 *                                    mesh->brep structure is not modified.
 * mesh->brep.numSurfacesPerVolume[]: allocated with hxtALignedMalloc(), the 
 *                                    nbr. of bounding surfaces for each
 *                                    aforementioned volume
 * mesh->brep.surfacesPerVolume[];    allocated with hxtALignedMalloc(), the

 * !mesh->brep.curvesPerSurface

 * !mesh->brep.numPoints
 * !mesh->brep.points

/* APPENDIX B: using structures as function argument in C99
 * ========================================================
 *
 * We use a single `HXTTetMeshOptions` structure for options, instead of multiple.
 * function arguments. This has several advantages:
 *
 * 1. It simplifies calling the function multiple time with the same arguments
 * 2. You  can use designated initializer like this:
 *    ```
 *    HXTMesh3dOptions options = {
 *      .verbosity = 1,
 *      .stat = 1,
 *      .refine = 1,
 *      .optimize = 1,
 *      .quality.min = 0.35,
 *    }
 *    ```
 *    Everything that is not explicitly initialized is set to zero.
 *    => You wont have to change anything if the order of arguments changes or if
 *    another option is added (because our options always have 0 as sane default).
 * 3. With compound literals, you can give argument directly in the function, like this:
 *    ```
 *    hxtTetMesh3d(mesh, &(HXTMesh3dOptions) {.refine=1,
 *                                            .optimize=1,
 *                                            .stat=1,
 *                                            .quality.min=0.35 });
 *    ```
 *    This is even shorter than without using a structure.
