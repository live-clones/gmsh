The original source code must be distributed.

Christophe,

You can do that but be aware that metis/parmetis is not being distributed
under an open source license.

Dear George,

For the past few years a colleague and I have been developing an open
source finite element mesh generator and pre-/post-processor
(http://geuz.org/gmsh/). We would like to distribute METIS (and
eventually PARMETIS) with the application. Can we do so?

Thanks to let me know.

Best wishes,

Christophe
