 *
 * @param[in] gf CAD face containing the elements
 * @param[in] elements Elements (triangles or quads) in the input patch. May be empty
 * @param[in] intVertices Interior vertices in the input patch. May be empty
 * @param[in] bdrVertices Patch ordered boundary vertex loop, minimum 4 vertices
 * @param[in] bndIdealValence The ideal inside quad valence for the boundary corners
 * @param[in] bndAllowedValenceRange The allowed range of inside quad valence
 * @param[in] neighborsForGeometry Adjacent elements that may be used for geometry untangling
 * @param[in] minSICNafer Minimum SICN quality required in the remeshed patch. 
 *                        Compared after geometry untangling/smoothing.
 * @param[in] invertNormalsForQuality The CAD normals are used to compute signed quality.
 *                                    This flag invert invert the CAD normals in the measure.
 * @param[in] sp If not nullptr, the surface projector is used instead of the CAD parametrization
 *               in the smoothing. Required if there is no surface parametrization.
 * @param[out] diff The mesh diff (to the GFace) containing the remeshing candidate
 *
 * @return 0 if a valid remeshing has been found
