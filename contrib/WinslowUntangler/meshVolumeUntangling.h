/**
 * @brief Untangling/smoothing of volume mesh based on minimization of the
 *        Winslow functional, with regularization for tangled elements.
 *        See the following paper for details:
 *          Foldover-free maps in 50 lines of code.
 *          Garanzha, V., Kaporin, I., Kudryavtseva, L., Protais, F., Ray, N., & Sokolov, D. (2021). 
 *          arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.03069.
 *        Non-tetrahedron elements are subdivided into (overlapping) tetrahedra for the smoothing.
 *        Only for linear geometry, not high-order.
 *        Mesh vertices on boundary curves and surfaces are fixed.
 *
 * @param gr The region containing the volume elements
 * @param iterMax Number of outer iterations in the optimization (re-evaluation of coefficients in Winslow)
 *                Typical range is 10-100.
 * @param timeMax Maximum time budget for the smoothing (in seconds)
 *
 * @return True if the smoothing have been applied (mesh may still be tangled)
