This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator, primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities.

To install Gmsh, type

./configure --disable-gsl
make
make install

This requires FLTK 1.1.x (configured with OpenGL support; freely
available from http://www.fltk.org) properly installed on your
system. Please note that compiling the Windows version requires the
Cygwin tools (freely available from http://www.cygwin.com).

To install a non-graphical version of Gmsh (that does not require FLTK
nor OpenGL), type

./configure --disable-gsl --disable-gui
make
make install

For a description of all other configuration options, type

./configure --help
