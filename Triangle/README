If you want to use Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle as an alternative
isotropic 2D mesh generator in Gmsh, please download Triangle from the
author's web site at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html,
unpack the archive and copy the two files 'triangle.c' and
'triangle.h' in this directory. Then run configure and rebuild Gmsh.

Please note that by doing so, you agree to Triangle's licensing
requirements (stated below). Most notably, you can only redistribute
Gmsh if no compensation is received.

Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay
triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and quality conforming Delaunay
triangulations.  The latter can be generated with no small angles, and are
thus suitable for finite element analysis.  Show Me graphically displays
the contents of the geometric files used by Triangle.  Show Me can also
write images in PostScript form.

Information on the algorithms used by Triangle, including complete
references, can be found in the comments at the beginning of the triangle.c
source file.  Another listing of these references, with PostScript copies
of some of the papers, is available from the Web page

If you use Triangle, and especially if you use it to accomplish real
work, I would like very much to hear from you.  A short letter or email
(to jrs@cs.cmu.edu) describing how you use Triangle will mean a lot to
me.  The more people I know are using this program, the more easily I can
justify spending time on improvements and on the three-dimensional
successor to Triangle, which in turn will benefit you.  Also, I can put
you on a list to receive email whenever a new version of Triangle is
available.

If you use a mesh generated by Triangle or plotted by Show Me in a
publication, please include an acknowledgment as well.
