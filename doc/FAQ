Q. Gmsh complains about missing libraries.
A. Try 'ldd gmsh' to check if all required shared libraries are
installed on your system.

Q. Gmsh does not work under HP-UX.
A. the HP version is reported not to work with native OpenGL. You
should install Mesa instead.

Q. When moving the mouse over the graphic window, everything that is
drawn on it disappears, and each item is visible only when the cursor
is directly over it.
A. You should start Gmsh with the '-noov' command line option.

Q. The graphics display very slowly.
A. Are you are executing Gmsh from a remote host (via the network)
without GLX? You should turn double buffering off (with the -nodb
command line option).

Q. Big post-processing scenes are slow to display.
A. Try display lists (-dl command line option).

Q. Gmsh keeps re-displaying its graphics when other windows partially
hide the graphical window.
