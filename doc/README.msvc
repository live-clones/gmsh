To compile Gmsh with Microsoft Visual C++

1) launch the Visual Studio command prompt

2) go to the Gmsh source directory

4) rename "utils\misc\variables.msvc" into "variables" (in the root 
   of the Gmsh source directory)

5) edit "variables" to match your local installation of Gmsh and
   Visual C++ (and to configure which optional Gmsh features to build)

6) type "utils\misc\gmake.exe"
