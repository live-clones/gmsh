@cindex Introduction
@cindex Overview

Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator,
primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Its
primal design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
cases with parametric input and up to date visualization capabilities.  One
of the strengths of Gmsh is its ability to respect a characteristic length
field for the generation of adapted meshes on lines, surfaces and
volumes. These adapted meshes can be mixed with simple structured
(transfinite, extruded, etc.) meshes in order to augment the flexibility.
All geometrical, mesh, solver and post-processing instructions are
prescribed either interactively using the graphical user interface or in
ASCII data files using Gmsh's own scripting language.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Describe quickly simple and/or ``repetitive'' geometries. Models are
constructed by defining successively points, curves, surfaces and volumes
(@pxref{Geometry}). Loops and includes can be used to perform repetitive
tasks (@pxref{Loops and tests}, @pxref{General commands}).
@item
Parameterize these geometries: the model is described in Gmsh's own
language, where all commands and command arguments can depend on previous
calculations.
@item
Generate 1D, 2D and 3D simplicial (i.e. using line segments, triangles and
tetrahedra) finite element meshes. The 1D and 2D algorithms should have
pretty good performance in most cases. The 3D algorithm is still more
experimental.
@item
Specify target element sizes: Gmsh provides several mechanisms to control
the size of the elements in the final (interpolation from geometrical point
characteristic lengths, explicit background mesh, attractors).
@item
Create simple extruded geometries and meshes.
@item
Interact with your solver: Gmsh provides C/C++ and perl interfaces, and
others can be easily added (@pxref{Solver}).
@item
Visualize computational results in a great variety of ways. Gmsh can
display scalar, vector and tensor data sets in many different ways.
@item
Perform various operations on the post-processing views using plugins
(@pxref{Post-processing}).
@item
Exports plots in many different formats (vector PostScript or encapsulated
PostScript, LaTeX, PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.).
@item
Generate complex animations.
@item
Run on low end machines and/or machines without graphic systems: Gmsh can be
compiled with or without the graphical user interface; graphical versions
can be used either interactively or without graphicak output, directly from
the command-line.
@item
Configure your preferred options for all subsequent operations: Gmsh has a
large number of configurations options that can be set interactively,
scattered inside command files (and changed on the fly in scripts), set in
per-user configuration files, or specified on the command-line
(@pxref{General options}, @pxref{Geometry options}, @pxref{Mesh options},
@pxref{Post-processing options}, @pxref{Running Gmsh}).

@itemize @bullet
@item
The bottom-up approach for describing geometries can become tedious for
complex structures.
@item
There is no support for NURBS and only very limited support for trimmed
surfaces.
@item
Gmsh is not primarily a structured mesh generator: no automatic
quadrilateral or hexahedral meshing algorithm is provided. If you want
quadrangles, you have to use transfinite or extruded meshes (@pxref{Mesh})
or recombine unstructured triangular meshes. For hexahedra, your only choice
is transfinite or extruded meshes.
@item
Gmsh is not a multibloc generator: all meshes produced by Gmsh are
conforming in the sense of finite element meshes (@pxref{Mesh})
@item
There is not support for curved mesh elements as of this writing (Gmsh
1.44).
@item
Gmsh is designed for solving academic test-cases, not industrial-size

@cindex Overview

Gmsh is structured around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done
either interactively, or in text data files (interactive specifications
generate language bits in the input file, and vice versa). The accessibility
of most features in the ASCII text file makes it possible to automate all
treatments (loops, tests and external access methods permit advanced
scripting capabilities). The internal kernel of Gmsh reflects this
structure: it is built around a geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing
module. A brief description of these four modules is given hereafter.

@node Geometry, Mesh, Overview, Overview
@section Geometry: geometrical entity definition

Geometries are created in a bottom-up flow by successively defining
points, oriented curves (segments, circles, ellipses, splines, etc.),
oriented surfaces (plane surfaces, ruled surfaces, etc.) and
volumes. Compound groups of geometrical entities can be defined, based
on these elementary parametrized geometric entities. Data can be
defined either interactively thanks to the menu system, or directly in
the ASCII input files.  The scripting possibilities (with loops,
tests, arrays of variables, etc.) allow fully parametrized definitions
of all geometrical entities.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Mesh: finite element mesh generation
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Mesh, Solver, Geometry, Overview
@section Mesh: finite element mesh generation

A finite element mesh is a tessellation of a given subset of R3 by
elementary geometrical elements of various shapes (in this case lines,
triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra, prisms, hexahedra and pyramids),
arranged in such a way that if two of them intersect, they do so along a
face, an edge or a node, and never otherwise. All the finite element meshes
produced by Gmsh as unstructured, even if they were generated in a
structured way. This implies that the elementary geometrical elements are
defined only by an ordered list of their vertices (which allows the
orientation of all their lower order geometrical entities) but no predefined
relation is assumed between any two elementary elements.

The mesh generation is performed in the same order as the geometry
creation: curves are discretized first; the mesh of the curves is then
used to mesh the surfaces; then the mesh of the surfaces is used to
mesh the volumes. This automatically assures the continuity of the
mesh when, for example, two surfaces share a common curve. Every
meshing step is constrained by the characteristic length field, which
can be uniform, specified by characteristic length associated to
elementary geometrical entities, or associated to another mesh (the
background mesh).

For each meshing step (i.e. the discretization of lines, surfaces and
volumes), all structured mesh directives are executed first, and serve
as additional constraints for the unstructured parts. The implemented
Delaunay algorithm is subdivided in the following five steps for
surface/volume discretization:

@enumerate
@item
trivial meshing of a box including the convex polygon/polyhedron defined by
the boundary nodes resulting from the discretization of the curves/surfaces;
@item
creation of the initial mesh by insertion of all the nodes on the
curves/surfaces thanks to the Bowyer algorithm;
@item
boundary restoration to force all the edges/faces of the curves/surfaces to
be present in the initial mesh;
@item
suppression of all the unwanted triangles/tetrahedra (in particular those
containing the nodes of the initial box);
@item
insertion of new nodes by the Bowyer algorithm until the characteristic size
of each simplex is lower or equal to the characteristic length field
evaluated at the center of its circumscribed circle/sphere.
@end enumerate

@node Solver, Post-processing, Mesh, Overview
@section Solver: external solver interface

External solvers can be interfaced with Gmsh through Unix sockets, which
permits to easily launch computations either locally or on remote computers,
and to collect and exploit the simulation results within Gmsh. The default
solver interfaced with Gmsh is GetDP

@node Post-processing,  , Solver, Overview
@section Post-processing: scalar and vector field visualization

Multiple post-processing scalar or vector maps can be loaded and manipulated
(globally or individually) along with the geometry and the mesh. Scalar
fields are represented by iso-value curves/surfaces or color maps and vector
fields by three-dimensional arrows or displacement maps. Post-processing
functions include arbitrary section computation, offset, elevation, boundary
extraction, color map and range modification, animation, vector graphic
output, etc. All post-processing options can be accessed either
interactively or through the input ASCII text files. Scripting permits to
automate all the post-processing operations (e.g. for the creation of
complex animations). User-defined operations can also be performed on
post-proessing views through to dynamically loadable modules (plug-ins).

@vindex @var{string-id}
@vindex @var{expression-char}
@vindex @var{expression}
@vindex @var{expression-id}
@vindex @var{expression-list}

Expressions are denoted by the metasyntactic variable @var{expression}
(remember the definition of the syntactic rules in @ref{Syntactic rules}):

The two constant types used in Gmsh are @var{real} and
@var{string}. There is no integer type.  These types have the same meaning
and syntax as in the C or C++ programming languages. Besides general
expressions (@var{expression}), purely constant expressions, denoted by the
metasyntactic variable @var{expression-cst}, are also used:

@example
@var{expression}:
  @var{real} |
  @var{expression-id} |
  @var{operator-unary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-left} @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-right} 
      @var{expression} |
  @var{function-id} [ < @var{expression-list} > ]
@end example

List of constant expressions are defined as:

@example
@var{expression-list}:
  @var{expression-list-item} <,@dots{}>
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-list-item}:
  @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression-id} @{@} |
  @var{expression-id} @{ @var{expression-list} @}
@end example

The second case in this last definition permits to create a list containing
the range of numbers comprised between the two @var{expression}, with a
unit incrementation step. The third case also permits to create a list
containing the range of numbers comprised between the two
@var{expression}, but with a positive or negative incrementation step
equal to the third @var{expression}. The fourth and fifth cases permit
to reference constant identifiers (@var{expression-id}s) of lists of constants
and constant identifiers of sublists of constants (see below for the
definition of constant identifiers) .

All @var{expression-cst} are evaluated during the parsing of the data file
syntactic analysis of the problem. The syntax for the definition of
expression identifiers is:

@example
@var{expression-id} = @var{expression-def};
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-id}:
  @var{string}

@var{expression-def}:
  @var{expression-list-item} |
  @{ @var{expression-list} @}
@end example

Note: Only one constant is predefined in Gmsh: @code{Pi} =
3.1415926535897932.

Constant character strings can also be defined. The syntax for their
definition is the following: XXX do we have this at the moment?

@example
@var{string-id} = "@var{string}";
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{string-id}:
  @var{string}
@end example

Character expressions can be defined, using these constant strings:

@example
@var{expression-char}:
  "@var{string}" |
  @var{string-id} |
  StrCat[ @var{expression-char} , @var{expression-char} ]
XXX Sprintf, etc.
@end example

@noindent The third case in this definition permits to concatenate two
character expressions.

@section Graphical vs. non-interactive mode

There are two ways to actually run these examples with Gmsh. (The
operations to run Gmsh may vary according to your operating system. In
the following examples, we will assume that you're working with a
UNIX-like shell.) The first working mode of Gmsh is the interactive
graphical mode. To launch Gmsh in interactive mode, just type

> gmsh

at the prompt on the command line. This will open two windows: the
graphic window (with a status bar at the bottom) and the menu window
(with a menu bar and some context dependent buttons). To open the
first tutorial file, select the 'File->Open' menu, and choose 't1.geo'
in the input field. To perform the mesh generation, go to the mesh
module (by selecting 'Mesh' in the module menu) and choose the
required dimension in the context-dependent buttons ('1D' will mesh
all the curves; '2D' will mesh all the surfaces ---as well as all the
curves if '1D' was not called before; '3D' will mesh all the volumes
---and all the surfaces if '2D' was not called before). To save the
resulting mesh in the current mesh format, choose 'Save' in the
context-dependent buttons, or select the appropriate format with the
'File->Save as' menu. The default mesh file name is based on the name
of the first input file on the command line (or 'untitled' if there
wasn't any input file given), with an appended extension depending on
the mesh format.

[NOTE: Nearly all the interactive commands have shortcuts. Select
'Help->Shortcuts' in the menu bar to learn about these shortcuts.]

Instead of opening the tutorial with the 'File->Open' menu, it is
often more convenient to put the file name on the command line, for
example with:

> gmsh t1.geo

[NOTE: Even if it is often handy to define the variables and the
points directly in the input files (you may use any text editor for
this purpose, e.g. Wordpad on Windows, or Emacs on Unix), it is almost
always more simple to define the curves, the surfaces and the volumes
interactively. To do so, just follow the context dependent buttons in
the Geometry module. For example, to create a spline, select
'Geometry' in the module menu, and then select 'Elementary, Add, New,
Spline'. You will then be asked (in the status bar of the graphic
window) to select a list of points, and to click 'e' to finish the
selection (or 'q' to abort it). Once the interactive command is
completed, a string is automatically added at the end of the currently
opened project file.]

The second operating mode for Gmsh is the non-interactive mode. In
this mode, there is no graphical user interface, and all operations
are performed without any interaction. To mesh the first tutorial in
non-interactive mode, just type:

> gmsh t1.geo -2

To mesh the same example, but with the background mesh available in the
file 'bgmesh.pos', just type:

> gmsh t1.geo -2 -bgm bgmesh.pos

[NOTE: You should read the notes in the file 'bgmesh.pos' if you
intend to use background meshes.]

Several files can be loaded simultaneously in Gmsh. The first one
defines the project, while the others are appended ("merged") to this
project. You can merge such files with the 'File->Merge' menu, or by
directly specifying the names of the files on the command line. This
is most useful for post-processing purposes. For example, to merge the
post-processing views contained in the files 'view1.pos' and
'view2.pos' together with the first tutorial 't1.geo', you can type
the following command:

> gmsh t1.geo view1.pos view2.pos

In the Post-Processing module (select 'Post_Processing' in the module
menu), two view buttons will appear, respectively labeled "a scalar
map" and "a vector map". A mouse click on the name will toggle the
visibility of the selected view, while a click on the arrow button on
the right will provide access to the view's options. If you want the
modifications made to one view to affect also all the other views,
select the 'Apply next changes to all views' or 'Force same options
for all views' option in the 'Tools->Options->Post-processing' menu.

[NOTE: All the options specified interactively can also be directly
specified in the ASCII input files. All available options, with their
current values, can be saved into a file by selecting 'File->Save
as->Gmsh options', or simply viewed by pressing the '?' button in the
status bar. To save the current options as your default preferences
for all future Gmsh sessions, use the 'Tools->Options->Save' button.]

@cindex Gmsh, file format
@cindex Mesh, file format
@cindex File, mesh
@cindex File, @file{.msh}
@cindex @file{.msh} file

The native Gmsh mesh format read is divided into two sections, defining the
nodes and the elements in the mesh.

@example
$NOD
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
@dots{}
$ENDNOD
$ELM
@var{number-of-elements}
@var{elm-number} @var{elm-type} @var{elm-region} @var{unused} @var{number-of-nodes} @var{node-numbers}
@dots{}
$ENDELM
@end example

@noindent
All the syntactic variables stand for integers except @var{x-coord},
@var{y-coord} and @var{z-coord} which stand for floating point values.
The @var{elm-type} value defines the geometrical type for the element:

@noindent
@var{elm-type}:

@table @code

Install the 'info' version of this user's guide! On your (Unix) system, this
can be achieved by 1) copying all gmsh.info* files to the place where your
info files live (usually /usr/info), and 2) issuing the command
'install-info /usr/info/gmsh.info /usr/info/dir'. You will then be able to
access the documentation with the command 'info gmsh'. Note that particular
sections ("nodes") can be accessed directly. For example, 'info gmsh
extrude' will take you directly to the definition of the Extrude command.
@item
Use emacs to edit your files, and load the C++ mode! This permits automatic
syntax highlighting and easy indentation. Automatic loading of the C++ mode
for @file{.pro} files can be achieved by adding the following command in
your @code{.emacs} file: @code{(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.pro$"
. c++-mode)) auto-mode-alist))}.
@item
Define common geometrical objects and options in separate files, reusable in
all your problem definition structures.
