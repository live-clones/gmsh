@cindex Introduction
@cindex Overview

Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator
with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Its design goal is to
provide a simple meshing tool for academic problems with parametric
input and advanced visualization capabilities.

Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
post-processing. All geometrical, mesh, solver and post-processing
instructions are prescribed either interactively using the graphical user
interface (GUI) or in ASCII data files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
Interactive actions generate language bits in the input files, and vice
versa. This makes it possible to automate all treatments, using loops,
conditionals and external system calls. A brief description of the four
modules is given hereafter.

@c Geometry: geometrical entity definition
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Geometry, Mesh, Overview, Overview
@section Geometry: geometrical entity definition

Gmsh uses a boundary representation (``b-rep'') to describe geometries.
Models are created in a bottom-up flow by successively defining points,
oriented lines (line segments, circles, ellipses, splines, @dots{}),
oriented surfaces (plane surfaces, ruled surfaces, triangulated
surfaces, @dots{}) and volumes. Compound groups of geometrical entities
(called ``physical groups'') can also be defined, based on these
elementary geometric entities. Gmsh's scripting language allows all
geometrical entities to be fully parameterized.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Mesh: finite element mesh generation
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Mesh, Solver, Geometry, Overview
@section Mesh: finite element mesh generation

A finite element mesh is a tessellation of a given subset of the
three-dimensional space by elementary geometrical elements of various
shapes (in Gmsh's case: lines, triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra,
prisms, hexahedra and pyramids), arranged in such a way that if two of
them intersect, they do so along a face, an edge or a node, and never
otherwise. All the finite element meshes produced by Gmsh are considered
as ``unstructured'', even if they were generated in a ``structured'' way
(e.g., by extrusion). This implies that the elementary geometrical
elements are defined only by an ordered list of their nodes but that no
predefined order relation is assumed between any two elements.

The mesh generation is performed in the same bottom-up flow as the
geometry creation: lines are discretized first; the mesh of the lines is
then used to mesh the surfaces; then the mesh of the surfaces is used to
mesh the volumes. In this process, the mesh of an entity is only
constrained by the mesh of its boundary@footnote{For example, in three
dimensions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the triangles discretizing a surface will be forced to be faces of
tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only if the surface is part of the
boundary of a volume;
@item
the line elements discretizing a curve will be forced to be edges of
tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only if the curve is part of the
boundary of a surface, itself part of the boundary of a volume;
@item
a single node discretizing a point in the middle of a volume will be
forced to be a vertex of one of the tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only
if this point is connected to a curve, itself part of the boundary of a
surface, itself part of the boundary of a volume...
@end itemize
}. This automatically assures the conformity of the mesh when, for
example, two surfaces share a common line. But this also implies that
the discretization of an ``isolated'' (@var{n}-1)-th dimensional entity
inside an @var{n}-th dimensional entity does @emph{not} constrain the
@var{n}-th dimensional mesh.  Every meshing step is constrained by the
characteristic length field, which can be uniform, specified by
characteristic lengths associated with elementary geometrical entities,
associated with another mesh (the ``background mesh''), or defined by
point or line ``attractors''.

For each meshing step, all structured mesh directives are executed
first, and serve as additional constraints for the unstructured parts
@footnote{Note that mixing structured volume grids with unstructured
volume grids generated with the default 3D isotropic Delaunay algorithm
can result, in certain cases, to non-conform surface meshes on their
shared boundary. If this happens, you may consider using the Netgen
algorithm for the unstructured part.}.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Solver: external solver interface
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Solver, Post-processing, Mesh, Overview
@section Solver: external solver interface

External solvers can be interfaced with Gmsh through Unix or TCP/IP
sockets, which permits to launch external computations and to collect
and process the results directly from within Gmsh's post-processing
module. The default solver interfaced with Gmsh is GetDP
(@uref{http://www.geuz.org/getdp/}). Examples on how to interface
solvers written in C, C++, Perl and Python are available in the source
distribution (in the @file{utils/solvers/} directory).

@c Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Post-processing, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Solver, Overview
@section Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization

Gmsh can load and manipulate multiple post-processing scalar, vector or
tensor maps along with the geometry and the mesh. Scalar fields are
represented by iso-value lines/surfaces or color maps, while vector
fields are represented by three-dimensional arrows or displacement
maps. Post-processing functions include section computation, offset,
elevation, boundary and component extraction, color map and range
modification, animation, vector graphic output, etc. All the
post-processing options can be accessed either interactively or through
the input ASCII text files. Scripting permits to automate all
post-processing operations, as for example to create
animations. User-defined operations can also be performed on
post-processing views through dynamically loadable plugins.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node What Gmsh is pretty good at, and what Gmsh is not so good at, Post-processing, Overview
@section What Gmsh is pretty good at @dots{}

Gmsh is a (relatively) small program, and was principally developed ``in
academia, to solve academic problems''@dots{} Nevertheless, over the
years, many people outside universities have found Gmsh useful in their
day-to-day jobs. Here is a tentative list of what Gmsh does best:

@itemize @bullet
@item
quickly describe simple and/or ``repetitive'' geometries, thanks to
user-defined functions, loops, conditionals and includes (see
@ref{User-defined functions}, @ref{Loops and conditionals}, and @ref{General
commands});
@item
parameterize these geometries. Gmsh's scripting language enables all
commands and command arguments to depend on previous calculations (see
@ref{Expressions}, and @ref{Geometry commands});
@item
import complex models in industry-standard formats like STEP or IGES
(when Gmsh is built with OpenCascade support);
@item
generate 1D, 2D and 3D simplicial (i.e., using line segments, triangles and
tetrahedra) finite element meshes. The performance of the 1D and 2D
algorithms is pretty good; the 3D algorithm is still experimental and slow
(see @ref{Mesh module}, and @ref{Tutorial});
@item
specify target element sizes accurately. Gmsh provides several
mechanisms to control the size of the elements in the final mesh:
through interpolation from sizes specified at geometry points or on a
background mesh, or using attractors (@pxref{Mesh commands});
@item
create simple extruded geometries and meshes (see @ref{Geometry commands},
and @ref{Mesh commands});
@item
interact with external solvers. Gmsh provides C, C++, Perl and Python
interfaces, and others can be easily added (@pxref{Solver module});
@item
visualize computational results in a great variety of ways. Gmsh can display
scalar, vector and tensor data sets, and can perform various operations on
the resulting post-processing views (@pxref{Post-processing module});
@item
export plots in many different formats: vector PostScript or encapsulated
PostScript, LaTeX, PNG, JPEG, @dots{} (@pxref{General options});
@item
generate complex animations (see @ref{General tools}, and @ref{t8.geo});
@item
run on low end machines and/or machines with no graphical
interface. Gmsh can be compiled with or without the GUI, and all
versions can be used either interactively or directly from the command
line (@pxref{Running Gmsh});
@item
configure your preferred options. Gmsh has a large number of configuration
options that can be set interactively using the GUI, scattered inside
command files, changed on the fly in scripts, set in per-user configuration
files, or specified on the command-line (see @ref{General options},
@ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Post-processing options},
and @ref{Running Gmsh});
@item
and do all the above on various platforms (Windows, Mac and Unix), for free
(@pxref{Copying conditions}), using clear-text ASCII files and/or a small
but powerful graphical user interface.
@end itemize

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c ... and what Gmsh is not so good at
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node and what Gmsh is not so good at, Syntactic rules, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Overview
@section @dots{} and what Gmsh is not so good at

Due to its historical background and limited developer manpower, Gmsh has
also some (a lot of?) weaknesses:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the b-rep approach for describing geometries can become inconvenient for
complex models;
@item
there is no support for Nurbs and only very limited support for trimmed
surfaces in Gmsh's scripting language (however you can import STEP or
IGES models with such features when Gmsh is built with OpenCascade
support);
@item
Gmsh is not primarily a structured mesh generator: no automatic
quadrilateral or hexahedral meshing algorithm is provided. If you want
quadrangles, you have to use transfinite or extruded meshes or recombine
unstructured triangular meshes. For hexahedra, your only choice is
transfinite or extruded meshes;
@item
Gmsh is not a multi-bloc generator: all meshes produced by Gmsh are
conforming in the sense of finite element meshes;
@item
the 3D unstructured algorithm is still experimental and not very robust.
If this algorithm fail, try to change some characteristic lengths to
generate meshes that better suit the geometrical details of the
structures;
@item
Gmsh was designed to solve academic ``test cases'', not industrial-size
problems. You may find that Gmsh is too slow for large problems (with
thousands of geometric primitives, or millions of mesh/post-processing
elements).
@end itemize

If you have the skills and some free time, feel free to join the project! We
gladly accept any code contributions (@pxref{Programming notes}) to remedy
the aforementioned (and all other) shortcomings...

@chapter General tools

This chapter describes the general commands and options that can be used in
Gmsh's ASCII text input files. By ``general'', we mean ``not specifically
related to one of the geometry, mesh, solver or post-processing
modules''. Commands peculiar to these modules will be introduced in
@ref{Geometry module}, @ref{Mesh module}, @ref{Solver module}, and
@ref{Post-processing module}, respectively.

Note that, if you are just beginning to use Gmsh, or just want to see what
Gmsh is all about, you really don't need to read this chapter and the four
next ones. Just have a quick look at @ref{Running Gmsh}, and go play with
the graphical user interface, running the tutorials and demonstration files
bundled in the distribution! Most of the commands and options described in
the following chapters are available interactively in the GUI, so you don't
need to worry about Gmsh's internals for creating your first geometries,
meshes and post-processing plots. Once you master the tutorial (read the
source files: they are heavily commented---see @ref{Tutorial}), you might
want to come back here to learn more about the specific syntax of Gmsh's
commands and esoteric options.

@subsection Floating point expressions

@cindex Expressions, floating point
@cindex Real numbers
@cindex Numbers, real
@cindex Floating point numbers

Floating point expressions (or, more simply, ``expressions'') are denoted by
the metasyntactic variable @var{expression} (remember the definition of the
syntactic rules in @ref{Syntactic rules}), and are evaluated during the
parsing of the data file:

@example
@var{expression}:
  @var{real} |
  @var{string} |
  @var{string} [ @var{expression} ] |
  # @var{string} [ ] |
  ( @var{expression} ) |
  @var{operator-unary-left} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-unary-right} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-left} @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-right} @var{expression} |
  @var{built-in-function} |
  @var{real-option} |
  GetValue("@var{string}", @var{expression})
@end example

Such @w{@var{expression}s} are used in most of Gmsh's commands.  The third
and fourth cases in this definition permit to extract one item from a list
(see below) and get the size of a list, respectively. The operators
@var{operator-unary-left}, @var{operator-unary-right},
@var{operator-binary}, @var{operator-ternary-left} and
@var{operator-ternary-right} are defined in @ref{Operators}. For the
definition of @w{@var{built-in-function}s}, see @ref{Built-in
functions}. The various @w{@var{real-option}s} are listed in @ref{General
options}, @ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Solver options},
and @ref{Post-processing options}.

The last case in the definition allows to ask the user for a value
interactively. For example, inserting @code{GetValue("Value of parameter
alpha?", 5.76)} in an input file will query the user for the value of a
certain parameter alpha, assuming the default value is 5.76. If the option
@code{General.NoPopup} is set (@pxref{General options}), no question is
asked and the default value is automatically used.

@cindex Expressions, lists

List of expressions are also widely used, and are defined as:

@example
@var{expression-list}:
  @var{expression-list-item} <, @var{expression-list-item}> @dots{}
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-list-item}:
  @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{string} [ ] |
  @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] |
  Point @{ @var{expression} @} |
  @var{transform} |
  @var{extrude}
@c  @var{duplicata} - already implemented: should we explain this?
@end example

The second case in this last definition permits to create a list containing
the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s}, with a
unit incrementation step. The third case also permits to create a list
containing the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s},
but with a positive or negative incrementation step equal to the third
@var{expression}. The fourth case permits to reference an expression list.
The fifth case permits to reference an expression sublist (whose elements
are those corresponding to the indices provided by the
@var{expression-list}). The sixth case permits to retrieve the coordinates
of a given geometry point (@pxref{Points}). The last two cases permit to
retrieve the indices of entities created through geometrical transformations
and extrusions (see @ref{Transformations}, and @ref{Extrusions}).

@c todo: explain in detail what numbers are returned once we decide what to
@c do (chapeau et body pour extrude, etc.)...

To see the practical use of such expressions, have a look at the first
couple of examples in @ref{Tutorial}. Note that, in order to lighten the
syntax, you can always omit the braces @code{@{@}} enclosing an
@var{expression-list} if this @var{expression-list} only contains a single
item. Also note that a braced @var{expression-list} can be preceded by a
minus sign in order to change the sign of all the
@w{@var{expression-list-item}s}.

@cindex Expressions, character
@cindex Strings

Character expressions are defined as:

@example
@var{char-expression}:
  "@var{string}" |
  Today |
  StrPrefix ( @var{char-expression} ) |
  StrRelative ( @var{char-expression} ) |
  StrCat ( @var{char-expression} , @var{char-expression} ) |
  Sprintf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} ) |
  Sprintf ( @var{char-expression} )
  Sprintf ( @var{char-option} )
@end example

@noindent The third and fourth cases in this definition permit to take the
prefix (e.g. to remove the extension) or the relative path of a string. The
fifth case permits to concatenate two character expressions, and the sixth
and seventh are equivalent to the @code{sprintf} C function (where
@var{char-expression} is a format string that can contain floating point
formatting characters: @code{%e}, @code{%g}, etc.). The last case permits to
use the value of a @var{char-option} as a @var{char-expression}.  The
various @w{@var{char-option}s} are listed in @ref{General options},
@ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Solver options}, and
@ref{Post-processing options}.

Character expressions are mostly used to specify non-numeric options and
input/output file names. See @ref{t8.geo}, for an interesting usage of
@w{@var{char-expression}s} in an animation script.

@cindex Colors

Colors expressions are hybrids between fixed-length braced

@example
@var{color-expression}:
  @var{string} |
  @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @} |
  @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @} |
  @var{color-option}
@end example

@noindent The first case permits to use the X Windows names to refer to colors,
e.g., @code{Red}, @code{SpringGreen}, @code{LavenderBlush3}, @dots{}
(see @file{Common/Colors.h} in Gmsh's source tree for a complete list). The
second case permits to define colors by using three expressions to specify
their red, green and blue components (with values comprised between 0 and
255). The third case permits to define colors by using their red, green and
blue color components as well as their alpha channel. The last case permits
to use the value of a @var{color-option} as a @var{color-expression}. The
various @w{@var{color-option}s} are listed in @ref{General options},
@ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Solver options}, and

The following commands can be used anywhere in a Gmsh ASCII text input file:

@ftable @code

@item @var{string} = @var{expression};
Creates a new expression identifier @var{string}, or affects
@var{expression} to an existing expression identifier. Eleven expression
identifiers are predefined (hardcoded in Gmsh's parser):

@ftable @code
@item Pi
Returns 3.1415926535897932.

@item GMSH_MAJOR_VERSION
Returns Gmsh's major version number.

@item GMSH_MINOR_VERSION
Returns Gmsh's minor version number.

@item GMSH_PATCH_VERSION
Returns Gmsh's patch version number.

@item MPI_Size
Returns the number of processors on which Gmsh is running (always 1, except
if you compiled Gmsh's parallel extensions).

@item MPI_Rank
Returns the rank of the current processor.

@item newp
Returns the next available point number. As explained in @ref{Geometry
module}, a unique number must be associated with every geometrical point:
@code{newp} permits to know the highest number already attributed (plus
one). This is mostly useful when writing user-defined functions
(@pxref{User-defined functions}) or general geometric primitives, when one
does not know @emph{a priori} which numbers are already attributed, and
which ones are still available.

@item newl
Returns the next available line number.

@item news
Returns the next available surface number.

@item newv
Returns the next available volume number.

@item newll
Returns the next available line loop number.

@item newsl
Returns the next available surface loop number.

@item newreg
Returns the next available region number. That is, @code{newreg} returns the
maximum of @code{newp}, @code{newl}, @code{news}, @code{newv} and all
physical entity numbers@footnote{For compatibility purposes, the behavior
of @code{newl}, @code{news}, @code{newv} and @code{newreg} can be modified
with the @code{Geometry.OldNewReg} option (@pxref{Geometry options}).}.
@end ftable

@item @var{string} [ ] = @{ @};
Creates a new expression list identifier @code{@var{string}[]} with an
empty list.

@item @var{string} [ ] = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Creates a new expression list identifier @code{@var{string}[]} with the
list @var{expression-list}, or affects @var{expression-list} to an
existing expression list identifier. (Remember the remark we made when
we defined @w{@var{expression-list}s}: the braces enclosing an
@var{expression-list} are optional if the list only contains a single
item.)

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Affects each item in the right hand side @var{expression-list} to the
elements (indexed by the left hand side @var{expression-list}) of an
existing expression list identifier. The two @w{@var{expression-list}s} must
contain the same number of items. 

@item @var{real-option} = @var{expression};
Affects @var{expression} to a real option.

@item @var{char-option} = @var{char-expression};
Affects @var{char-expression} to a character option.

@item @var{color-option} = @var{color-expression};
Affects @var{color-expression} to a color option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} += @var{expression};
Adds and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier or to
a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} -= @var{expression};
Subtracts and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} *= @var{expression};
Multiplies and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} /= @var{expression};
Divides and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} [ ] += @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Appends @var{expression-list} to an existing expression list or creates
a new expression list with @var{expression-list}).

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] += @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Adds and affects, item per item, the right hand side @var{expression-list}
to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] -= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Subtracts and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] *= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Multiplies and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] /= @{ @var{expression-list} @};

@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item Exit;
Aborts the current script.

@item Printf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} );
Prints a character expression in the information window and/or on the
terminal. @code{Printf} is equivalent to the @code{printf} C function:
@var{char-expression} is a format string that can contain formatting
characters (@code{%f}, @code{%e}, etc.). Note that all @w{@var{expression}s}
are evaluated as floating point values in Gmsh (@pxref{Expressions}), so
that only valid floating point formatting characters make sense in
@var{char-expression}. See @ref{t5.geo}, for an example of the use of
@code{Printf}.

@item Printf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} ) > @var{char-expression};
Same as @code{Printf} above, but output the expression in a file.

@item Printf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} ) >> @var{char-expression};
Same as @code{Printf} above, but appends the expression at the end of
the file.

@item Merge @var{char-expression};
Merges a file named @var{char-expression}. This command is equivalent to the
`File->Merge' menu in the graphical user interface. If the path in
@var{char-expression} is not absolute, @var{char-expression} is appended to
the path of the current file.

@item Draw;
Redraws the scene.

@item BoundingBox;
Recomputes the bounding box of the scene (which is normally computed only
after new geometrical entities are added or after files are included or
merged). The bounding box is computed as follows:
@enumerate
@item
If there is a mesh (i.e., at least one mesh vertex), the bounding
box is taken as the box enclosing all the mesh vertices;
@item
If there is no mesh but there is a geometry (i.e., at least one geometrical
point), the bounding box is taken as the box enclosing all the geometrical
points;
@item
If there is no mesh and no geometry, but there are some post-processing
views, the bounding box is taken as the box enclosing all the primitives in
the views.
@end enumerate

@item BoundingBox @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @};
Forces the bounding box of the scene to the given @w{@var{expression}s} (X
min, X max, Y min, Y max, Z min, Z max).

@item Delete All;
Deletes all geometrical entities and all currently loaded meshes.

@item Delete Physicals;
Deletes all physical groups.

@item Print @var{char-expression};
Prints the graphic window in a file named @var{char-expression}, using the
current @code{Print.Format} (@pxref{General options}). If the path in
@var{char-expression} is not absolute, @var{char-expression} is appended to
the path of the current file.

@item Sleep @var{expression};
Suspends the execution of Gmsh during @var{expression} seconds.

@item Status @var{expression};
Forces mesh status to @var{expression}.

@item System @var{char-expression};
Executes a system call.

@item Include @var{char-expression};
Includes the file named @var{char-expression} at the current position in the
input file. The include command should be given on a line of its own.  If
the path in @var{char-expression} is not absolute, @var{char-expression} is
appended to the path of the current file.

the default values to see the actual types). Most of these options are
accessible in the graphical user interface, but not all of them. When
running Gmsh interactively, changing an option in the ASCII text input file
will modify the option in the GUI in real time. This permits for example to
resize the graphical window in a script, or to interact with animations in
the script and in the GUI at the same time.

Gmsh's default behavior is to save some of these options in a per-user
``session resource'' file (@code{General.SessionFileName}) every time Gmsh
is shut down. This permits for example to automatically remember the size
and location of the windows or which fonts to use. Other options can be
saved in a per-user ``option'' file (@code{General.OptionsFileName}),
automatically loaded by Gmsh every time it starts up, by using the
`Tools->Options->Save as defaults' menu.

@chapter Geometry module

@cindex Geometry, module
@cindex Module, geometry

Gmsh's geometry module provides a simple CAD engine, using a bottom-up
(boundary representation) approach: you need to first define points (using
the @code{Point} command: see below), then lines (using @code{Line},
@code{Circle}, @code{Spline}, @dots{}, commands or by extruding points),
then surfaces (using for example the @code{Plane Surface} or @code{Ruled
Surface} commands, or by extruding lines), and finally volumes (using the
@code{Volume} command or by extruding surfaces).

These geometrical entities are called ``elementary'' in Gmsh's jargon, and
are assigned identification numbers when they are created:

@enumerate
@item each elementary point must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary line must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary surface must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary volume must possess a unique identification number.
@end enumerate

@noindent Elementary geometrical entities can then be manipulated in various
ways, for example using the @code{Translate}, @code{Rotate}, @code{Scale} or
@code{Symmetry} commands.

Compound groups of elementary geometrical entities can also be defined and
are called ``physical'' entities. These physical entities cannot be modified
by geometry commands: their only purpose is to assemble elementary entities
into larger groups, possibly modifying their orientation, so that they can
be referred to by the mesh module as single entities. As is the case with
elementary entities, each physical point, physical line, physical surface or
physical volume must be assigned a unique identification number. See
@ref{Mesh module}, for more information about how physical entities affect
the way meshes are saved.

points.

@item Line Loop ( @var{expression} ) = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Creates an oriented line loop. The @var{expression} inside the parentheses
is the line loop's identification number; the @var{expression-list} on the
right hand side should contain the identification numbers of all the
elementary lines that constitute the line loop. A line loop must be a closed
loop, and the elementary lines should be ordered and oriented (using
negative identification numbers to specify reverse orientation). If the
orientation is correct, but the ordering is wrong, Gmsh will actually
reorder the list internally to create a consistent loop. Although Gmsh
supports it, it is not recommended to specify multiple line loops (or
subloops) in a single @code{Line Loop} command. (Line loops are used to
create surfaces: see @ref{Surfaces}.)

@item Physical Line ( @var{expression} | @var{char-expression} ) = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Creates a physical line. The @var{expression} inside the parentheses is
the physical line's identification number (if a @var{char-expression} is
given instead, a unique identification number is automatically
created); the @var{expression-list} on the right hand side should
contain the identification numbers of all the elementary lines that need
to be grouped inside the physical line. Specifying negative
identification numbers in the @var{expression-list} will reverse the
orientation of the mesh elements belonging to the corresponding
elementary lines in the saved mesh.

Gmsh's mesh module regroups several 1D, 2D and 3D mesh algorithms, all
producing grids conforming in the sense of finite elements (@pxref{Mesh}).

The 2D @emph{unstructured} algorithms generate triangles or both triangles
and quadrangles (when @code{Recombine Surface} is used: see
@ref{Miscellaneous mesh commands}). The 3D unstructured algorithms only
generate tetrahedra.

The 2D @emph{structured} algorithms (transfinite and extrusion) generate
triangles by default, but quadrangles can be obtained by using the
@code{Recombine} commands (see @ref{Structured grids}, and
@ref{Miscellaneous mesh commands}). The 3D structured algorithms
generate tetrahedra, hexahedra, prisms and pyramids, depending on the
type of the surface meshes they are based on.

@c holes with surfaces in contact with the exterior shell, intersecting

@section Elementary vs. physical entities

If only elementary geometrical entities are defined (or if the
@code{Mesh.SaveAll} option is set; see @ref{Mesh options}), the grid
produced by the mesh module will be saved ``as is''. That is, all the
elements in the grid will be saved to disk using the identification
number of the elementary entities they discretize as their elementary
region number (and 0 as their physical region number@footnote{This
behaviour was introduced in Gmsh 2.0. In older versions, both the
elementary and the physical region numbers would be set to the
identification number of the elementary region.}; @ref{Gmsh mesh file
formats}). This can sometimes be inconvenient:

@itemize @bullet
@item
mesh elements cannot be duplicated;
@item 
the orientation of the mesh elements (the ordering of their nodes) is
determined entirely by the orientation of their ``parent'' elementary
entities, and cannot be modified;
@item
elements belonging to different elementary entities cannot be linked as
being part of a larger group having a physical or mathematical meaning (like
`Left wing', `Metallic part', `Dirichlet boundary condition', @dots{}).
@end itemize

To remedy these problems, the geometry module (@pxref{Geometry module})
introduces the notion of ``physical'' entities (also called ``physical
groups''). The purpose of physical entities is to assemble elementary
entities into larger, possibly overlapping groups, and to control the
orientation of the elements in these groups. The introduction of
physical entities in large models usually greatly facilitates the
manipulation of the model (e.g., using `Tools->Visibility' in the GUI)
and the interfacing with external solvers.  

In the @file{.msh} file format (@pxref{Gmsh mesh file formats}), if
physical entities are defined, the output mesh only contains those
elements that belong to physical entities. Other file formats each treat
physical entities in slightly different ways, depending on their
capability to define groups.

@subsection Characteristic lengths

@cindex Characteristic lengths
@cindex Mesh, element size
@cindex Size, elements
@cindex Mesh, background
@cindex Background mesh

The `size' of a mesh element is defined as the length of the segment for a
line segment, the radius of the circumscribed circle for a triangle and the
radius of the circumscribed sphere for a tetrahedron. There are three main
ways to specify the size of the mesh elements for a given geometry:

@enumerate
@item
You can specify characteristic lengths at the points of the geometrical
model (with the @code{Point} command: see @ref{Points}). The size of the
mesh elements will then be computed by linearly interpolating these
characteristic lengths on the initial mesh (see @ref{Mesh}). This might
sometimes lead to over-refinement in some areas, so that you may have to
add ``dummy'' geometrical entities in the model in order to get the
desired element sizes.

This method works with all the algorithms implemented in the mesh
module. The final element sizes are of course constrained by the structured
algorithms for which the element sizes are explicitly specified (e.g.,
transfinite and extruded grids: see @ref{Structured grids}).
@item
You can give Gmsh an explicit background mesh in the form of a scalar
post-processing view (see @ref{Post-processing commands}, and @ref{File
formats}) in which the nodal values are the target element sizes.  This
method is very general but it requires a first (usually rough) mesh and
a way to compute the target sizes on this mesh (usually through an error
estimation procedure, in an iterative process of mesh adaptation). Note
that the target element sizes can be constrained by the characteristic
lengths defined in the geometrical model if the
@code{Mesh.ConstrainedBackgroundMesh} option is set. To load a
background mesh, you can use the @code{-bgm} command-line option
(@pxref{Command-line options}), select `Apply as background mesh' in the
post-processing view option menu, or use the @code{Background Mesh}
command in a script (@pxref{Post-processing commands}).

Background meshes are supported by all algorithms except the algorithms
based on Netgen.
@item
You can define point or line attractors. [More to come here later.]
@end enumerate

Here are the mesh commands that are related to the specification of
characteristic lengths:

@ftable @code
@item Characteristic Length @{ @var{expression-list} @} = @var{expression};
Modifies the characteristic length of the points whose identification
numbers are listed in @var{expression-list}. The new value is given by
@var{expression}.
@item Attractor Point @{ @var{expression-list} @} = @{ @var{expression-list} @};

@item Extrude @{ @var{expression-list} @} @{ @var{extrude-list} @var{layers} @}
Extrudes both the geometry and the mesh using a translation
(@pxref{Extrusions}). The @var{layers} option determines how the mesh is
extruded and has the following syntax:

@example
@var{layers}:
@group
  Layers @{ @var{expression} @} | 
  Layers @{ @{ @var{expression-list} @}, @{ @var{expression-list} @} @} | 
  Recombine; @dots{}
@end group
@end example

In the first @code{Layers} form, @var{expression} gives the number of
elements to be created in the (single) layer. In the second form, the
first @var{expression-list} defines how many elements should be created
in each extruded layer, and the second @var{expression-list} gives the
normalized height of each layer (the list should contain a sequence of
@var{n} numbers 0 < @var{h1} < @var{h2} < @dots{} < @var{hn} <= 1). See
@ref{t3.geo}, for an example.

For line extrusions, the @code{Recombine} option will recombine triangles
into quadrangles when possible.  For surface extrusions, the
@code{Recombine} option will recombine tetrahedra into prisms, hexahedra or
pyramids.

Please note that, starting with Gmsh 2.0, region numbers cannot be
specified explicitly anymore in @code{Layers} commands. Instead, as with
all other geometry commands, you must use the automatically created
entity identifier created by the extrusion command. For example, the
following extrusion command will return the id of the new ``top''
surface in @code{num[0]} and the id of the new volume in @code{num[1]}:
@example
num[] = Extrude @{0,0,1@} @{ Surface@{1@}; Layers@{10@}; @};

Extrudes both the geometry and the mesh using a combined translation and
rotation (@pxref{Extrusions}). The @var{layers} option is defined as
above.

@item Extrude @{ Surface @{ @var{expression-list} @}; @var{layers} @}
Extrudes a boundary layer along the normals of the specified surfaces.

@item Transfinite Line @{ @var{expression-list} @} = @var{expression} < Using Progression | Bump @var{expression} >;
Selects the lines in @var{expression-list} to be meshed with the 1D
transfinite algorithm. The @var{expression} on the right hand side gives the
number of nodes that will be created on the line (this overrides any
characteristic length prescription---see @ref{Characteristic lengths}). The
optional argument `@code{Using Progression @var{expression}}' instructs the
transfinite algorithm to distribute the nodes following a geometric
progression (@code{Progression 2} meaning for example that each line element
in the series will be twice as long as the preceding one). The optional
argument `@code{Using Bump @var{expression}}' instructs the transfinite
algorithm to distribute the nodes with a refinement at both ends of the
line.

(A deprecated synonym for @code{Progression} is @code{Power}.)

@item Transfinite Surface @{ @var{expression} @} = @{ @var{expression-list} @} < Left | Right | Alternate > ;
Selects the surface @var{expression} to be meshed with the 2D
transfinite algorithm. The @var{expression-list} should contain the
identification numbers of three or four points on the boundary of the
surface, defining the corners of the transfinite interpolation. The
optional argument specifies the way the triangles are oriented when the
mesh is not recombined.

@item Transfinite Volume @{ @var{expression} @} = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Selects a five- or six-face volume @var{expression} to be meshed with
the 3D transfinite algorithm.  The @var{expression-list} should contain
the identification numbers of the six or eight points on the boundary of
the volume that define the corners of the transfinite interpolation.

@cindex Module, Solver

Five external solvers can be interfaced simultaneously with Gmsh.

If you just want to start a solver from the solver module, with no further
interactions between the solver and Gmsh, just edit the options relative to
one of the five available solvers (e.g., @code{Solver.Name0},
@code{Solver.Executable0}, @dots{}; see @ref{Solver options}), and set the
corresponding ``client-server'' option to zero
(e.g., @code{Solver.ClientServer0 = 0}). This doesn't require any
modification to be made to the solver.

If you want the solver to interact with Gmsh (for error messages, option
definitions, post-processing, etc.), you need to link your solver with the
@file{GmshClient.c} file and add the appropriate function calls inside your
program. You can then proceed as in the previous case, but this time you
should set the client-server option to 1 (e.g., @code{Solver.ClientServer0 =
1}), so that Gmsh and the solver can communicate through a Unix socket. See
@ref{Solver example}, for an example of how to interface a C++
solver. Bindings for solvers written in other languages (C, Perl and Python)
are available in the source distribution.

@cindex Plots

@cindex Views

Gmsh's post-processing module can handle multiple scalar, vector or tensor
data sets along with the geometry and the mesh. The data sets should be
given in one of Gmsh's post-processing file formats described in @ref{File
formats}. Once loaded into Gmsh, scalar fields can be displayed as iso-value
lines and surfaces or color maps, whereas vector fields can be represented
either by three-dimensional arrows or by displacement maps. (Tensor fields
are currently displayed as Von-Mises effective stresses. To display other
(combinations of) components, use @code{Plugin(Extract)}: see
@ref{Post-processing plugins}.) 

In Gmsh's jargon, each data set is called a ``view'', and can arbitrarily
mix all types of elements and fields. Each view is given a name, and can be
manipulated either individually (each view has its own button in the GUI and
can be referred to by its index in a script) or globally (see the
@code{PostProcessing.Link} option in @ref{Post-processing options}).

By default, Gmsh treats all post-processing views as three-dimensional
plots, i.e., draws the scalar, vector and tensor primitives (points, lines,
triangles, tetrahedra, etc.) in 3D space. But Gmsh can also represent each
post-processing view containing @emph{scalar points} as two-dimensional
(``X-Y'') plots, either space- or time-oriented:

@itemize @bullet
@item
in a `2D space' plot, the scalar points are taken in the same order as they
are defined in the post-processing view: the abscissa of the 2D graph is
the curvilinear abscissa of the curve defined by the point series, and only
one curve is drawn using the values associated with the points. If several
time steps are available, each time step generates a new curve;
@item
in a `2D time' plot, one curve is drawn for each scalar point in the view
and the abscissa is the time step.
@end itemize

Although visualization is usually mostly an interactive task, Gmsh exposes
all the post-processing commands and options to the user in its scripting
language to permit a complete automation of the post-processing process (see
e.g., @ref{t8.geo}, and @ref{t9.geo}).

The two following sections summarize all available post-processing commands
and options. Most options apply to both 2D and 3D plots (colormaps,
point/line sizes, interval types, time step selection, etc.), but some are
peculiar to 3D (lightning, element selection, etc.) or 2D plots (abscissa
labels, etc.). Note that 2D plots can be positioned explicitly inside the
graphical window, or be automatically positioned in order to avoid overlaps.

Sample post-processing files in human-readable ``parsed'' format
(@pxref{Parsed post-processing file format}) are available in the
@file{tutorial} directory of Gmsh's distribution (@file{.pos} files).

@cindex Commands, post-processing

@ftable @code
@item Alias View[@var{expression}];
Creates an alias of the @var{expression}-th post-processing view. 

Note that @code{Alias} creates a logical duplicate of the view without
actually duplicating the data in memory. This is very useful when you want
multiple simultaneous renderings of the same large dataset (usually with
different display options), but you cannot afford to store all copies in
memory. If what you really want is multiple physical copies of the data,
just merge the file containing the post-processing view multiple times.

@item AliasWithOptions View[@var{expression}];
Creates an alias of the @var{expression}-th post-processing view and copies
all the options of the @var{expression}-th view to the new aliased view.

@item Combine ElementsByViewName;
Combines all the post-processing views having the same name into new views.
The combination is done ``spatially'', i.e., simply by appending the
elements at the end of the new views.

@item Combine ElementsFromAllViews | Combine Views;
Combines all the post-processing views into a single new view.  The
combination is done ``spatially'', i.e., simply by appending the elements at
the end of the new view.

@item Combine ElementsFromVisibleViews;
Combines all the visible post-processing views into a single new view. The
combination is done ``spatially'', i.e., simply by appending the elements at
the end of the new view.

@item Combine TimeStepsByViewName | Combine TimeSteps;
Combines the data from all the post-processing views having the same name
into new multi-time-step views. The combination is done ``temporally'',
i.e., as if the data in each view corresponds to a different time
instant. The combination will fail if the meshes in all the views are not
identical.

@item Combine TimeStepsFromAllViews;
Combines the data from all the post-processing views into a new
multi-time-step view. The combination is done ``temporally'', i.e., as if
the data in each view corresponds to a different time instant. The
combination will fail if the meshes in all the views are not identical.

@item Combine TimeStepsFromVisibleViews;
Combines the data from all the visible post-processing views into a new
multi-time-step view. The combination is done ``temporally'', i.e., as if
the data in each view corresponds to a different time instant. The
combination will fail if the meshes in all the views are not identical.

@item Delete View[@var{expression}];
Deletes (removes) the @var{expression}-th post-processing view. Note that
post-processing view numbers start at 0.

@item Delete Empty Views;
Deletes (removes) all the empty post-processing views.

@item Background Mesh View[@var{expression}];
Applies the @var{expression}-th post-processing view as the current
background mesh. Note that post-processing view numbers start at 0.

@item Plugin (@var{string}) . Run;
Executes the plugin @var{string}. The list of default plugins is given in
@ref{Post-processing plugins}.

@item Plugin (@var{string}) . @var{string} = @var{expression} | @var{char-expression};
Sets an option for a given plugin. See @ref{Post-processing plugins}, for a
list of default plugins and @ref{t9.geo}, for some examples.

@item Save View[@var{expression}] @var{char-expression};
Saves the the @var{expression}-th post-processing view in a file named
@var{char-expression}. If the path in @var{char-expression} is not absolute,
@var{char-expression} is appended to the path of the current file.

@item View "@var{string}" @{ @var{string} ( @var{expression-list} ) @{ @var{expression-list} @}; @dots{} @};
Creates a new post-processing view, named @code{"@var{string}"}. This is the
easiest way to create a post-processing view, but also the least efficient
(the view is read through Gmsh's script parser, which can become a bit slow
if the view is very large---e.g., with one million elements). Nevertheless,
this ``parsed'' post-processing format (explained in detail in @ref{Parsed
post-processing file format}) is very powerful, since all the values are
@var{expressions}. Two other formats, better suited for very large data
sets, are described in @ref{ASCII post-processing file format}, and
@ref{Binary post-processing file format}.

Post-processing plugins permit to extend the functionality of Gmsh's
post-processing module. The difference between regular post-processing
options (@pxref{Post-processing options}) and post-processing plugins is
that regular post-processing options only change the way the data is
displayed, while post-processing plugins either create new post-processing
views, or modify the data stored in a view (in a destructive, non-reversible
way).

Plugins are available in the graphical user interface by right-clicking
on a view button (or by clicking on the black arrow next to the view
button) and then selecting the `Plugin' submenu.

Here is the list of the plugins that are shipped by default with Gmsh:

@section Interactive mode

@cindex Interactive mode

Gmsh's first operating mode is the `interactive graphical mode'. To launch
Gmsh in interactive mode, just click or double-click on the Gmsh icon
(Windows and Mac), or type

@example
> gmsh
@end example

@noindent at your shell prompt in a terminal (Unix). This will open
two windows: the graphic window (with a status bar at the bottom) and the
menu window (with a menu bar and some context-dependent buttons). 

To open the first tutorial file (@pxref{Tutorial}), select the `File->Open'
menu, and choose @file{t1.geo} in the input field. When using a terminal,
you can also specify the file name directly on the command line, i.e.:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo
@end example

To perform the mesh generation, go to the mesh module (by selecting `Mesh'
in the module menu) and choose the required dimension in the
context-dependent buttons (`1D' will mesh all the lines; `2D' will mesh all
the surfaces---as well as all the lines if `1D' was not called before; `3D'
will mesh all the volumes---and all the surfaces if `2D' was not called
before). To save the resulting mesh in the current mesh format, choose
`Save' in the context-dependent buttons, or select the appropriate format
with the `File->Save As' menu. The default mesh file name is based on the
name of the first input file on the command line (or @file{untitled} if
there wasn't any input file given), with an appended extension depending on
the mesh format@footnote{Nearly all the interactive commands have shortcuts:
see @ref{Keyboard shortcuts}, or select `Help->Keyboard Shortcuts' in the
menu.}.

To create a new geometry or to modify an existing geometry, select
'Geometry' in the module menu, and follow the context-dependent buttons.
For example, to create a spline, select `Elementary', `Add', `New' and
`Spline'. You will then be asked to select a list of points, and to type
@kbd{e} to finish the selection (or @kbd{q} to abort it). Once the
interactive command is completed, a text string is automatically added at
the end of the current project file. You can edit this project file by hand
at any time by pressing the `Edit' button in the `Geometry' menu and then
reloading the project by pressing `Reload'. For example, it is often faster
to define variables and points directly in the project file, and then use
the graphical user interface to define the lines, the surfaces and the
volumes interactively.

Several files can be loaded simultaneously in Gmsh. The first one defines
the project, while the others are appended (`merged') to this project. You
can merge such files with the `File->Merge' menu, or by directly specifying
the names of the files on the command line. For example, to merge the
post-processing views contained in the files @file{view1.pos} and
@file{view2.pos} together with the geometry of the first tutorial
@file{t1.geo}, you can type the following command:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo view1.pos view2.pos
@end example

In the Post-Processing module (select `Post-Processing' in the module
menu), two view buttons will appear, respectively labeled `a scalar
map' and `a vector map'. A mouse click on the name will toggle the
visibility of the selected view, while a click on the arrow button on
the right will provide access to the view's options. If you want the
modifications made to one view to affect also all the other views,
select the `Apply next changes to all views' or `Force same options
for all views' option in the `Tools->Options->Post-processing' menu.

Note that all the options specified interactively can also be directly
specified in the ASCII input files. All available options, with their
current values, can be saved into a file by selecting `File->Save As->Gmsh
options', or simply viewed by pressing the `?' button in the status bar. To
save the current options as your default preferences for all future Gmsh
sessions, use the `Tools->Options->Save as defaults' button.

Gmsh's second operating mode is the non-interactive (or `batch') mode. In
this mode, there is no graphical user interface, and all operations are
performed without any user interaction@footnote{If you compile Gmsh without
the graphical user interface, i.e., with @code{./configure --disable-gui},
this is the only mode you have access to.}. For example, to mesh the first
tutorial in non-interactive mode, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2

To mesh the same example, but with the background mesh available in the file
@file{bgmesh.pos}, type:

The @file{.msh} file format, version 1.0, is Gmsh's old native mesh file
format, now superseded by the format described in @ref{Version 2.0 ASCII}.

In the @file{.msh} file format, version 1.0, the file is divided in two
sections, defining the nodes (@code{$NOD}-@code{$ENDNOD}) and the elements
(@code{$ELM}-@code{$ENDELM}) in the mesh:

@example
$NOD
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
@dots{}
$ENDNOD
$ELM
@var{number-of-elements}

@dots{}
$ENDELM
@end example

@noindent
where
@table @code
@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes in the mesh.

@item @var{node-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th node in the mesh;
@var{node-number} must be a postive (non-zero) integer. Note that the
@w{@var{node-number}s} do not necessarily have to form a dense nor an
ordered sequence.

@item @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
are the floating point values giving the X, Y and Z coordinates of the
@var{n}-th node.

@item @var{number-of-elements}
is the number of elements in the mesh.

@item @var{elm-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th element in the mesh;
@var{elm-number} must be a postive (non-zero) integer. Note that the
@w{@var{elm-number}s} do not necessarily have to form a dense nor an
ordered sequence.

@item @var{elm-type}
defines the geometrical type of the @var{n}-th element:

@node Version 2.0 ASCII, Version 2.0 Binary, Version 1.0, Gmsh mesh file formats
@subsection Version 2.0 ASCII

The version 2.0 of the @file{.msh} file format is Gmsh's new native mesh
file format. It is very similar to the old one (@pxref{Version 1.0}),
but is more general: it contains information about itself and allows to
associate an arbitrary number of integer tags with each element. Ialso
exists in both ASCII and binary form.

The @file{.msh} file format, version 2.0, is divided in three main
sections, defining the file format
(@code{$MeshFormat}-@code{$EndMeshFormat}), the nodes
(@code{$Nodes}-@code{$EndNodes}) and the elements
(@code{$Elements}-@code{$EndElements}) in the mesh:

@example
$MeshFormat
2.0 @var{file-type} @var{data-size}
$EndMeshFormat
$Nodes
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
@dots{}
$EndNodes
$Elements
@var{number-of-elements}
@var{elm-number} @var{elm-type} @var{number-of-tags} < @var{tag} > @dots{} @var{node-number-list}
@dots{}
$EndElements
@end example

@noindent
where
@table @code
@item @var{file-type}
is an integer equal to 0 in the ASCII file format.

@item @var{data-size}
is an integer equal to the size of the floating point numbers used in the
file (currently only @var{data-size} = sizeof(double) is supported).

@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes in the mesh.

@item @var{node-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th node in the mesh;
@var{node-number} must be a postive (non-zero) integer. Note that the
@w{@var{node-number}s} do not necessarily have to form a dense nor an
ordered sequence.

@item @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
are the floating point values giving the X, Y and Z coordinates of the
@var{n}-th node.

@item @var{number-of-elements}
is the number of elements in the mesh.

@item @var{elm-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th element in the mesh;
@var{elm-number} must be a postive (non-zero) integer. Note that the
@w{@var{elm-number}s} do not necessarily have to form a dense nor an
ordered sequence.

@item @var{elm-type}
defines the geometrical type of the @var{n}-th element:
@table @code
@item 1
2-node line.
@item 2
3-node triangle.
@item 3

with the edge).
@item 9
6-node second order triangle (3 nodes associated with the vertices and 3
with the edges).
@item 10
9-node second order quadrangle (4 nodes associated with the vertices, 4
with the edges and 1 with the face).
@item 11
10-node second order tetrahedron (4 nodes associated with the vertices
and 6 with the edges).
@item 12
27-node second order hexahedron (8 nodes associated with the vertices,
12 with the edges, 6 with the faces and 1 with the volume).
@item 13
18-node second order prism (6 nodes associated with the vertices, 9 with
the edges and 3 with the quadrangular faces).
@item 14
14-node second order pyramid (5 nodes associated with the vertices, 8
with the edges and 1 with the quadrangular face).
@item 15
1-node point.
@item 16
8-node second order quadrangle (4 nodes associated with the vertices and
4 with the edges).
@item 17
20-node second order hexahedron (8 nodes associated with the vertices
and 12 with the edges).
@item 18
15-node second order prism (6 nodes associated with the vertices and 9
with the edges).
@item 19
13-node second order pyramid (5 nodes associated with the vertices and 8
with the edges).
@end table
See below for the ordering of the nodes.

@item @var{number-of-tags}
gives the number of tags for the @var{n}-th element. By default, Gmsh
generates meshes with three tags and reads files with an arbitrary
number of tags: see below.

@item @var{tag}
is an integer tag associated with the @var{n}-th element. By default,
the first tag is the number of the physical entity to which the element
belongs; the second is the number of the elementary geometrical entity
to which the element belongs; the third is the number of a mesh
partition to which the element belongs. All tags must be postive
integers, or zero. A zero tag is equivalent to no tag.

@item @var{node-number-list}
is the list of the node numbers of the @var{n}-th element. The ordering of
the nodes is given in @ref{Gmsh node ordering}; for second order elements,
the first order nodes are given first, followed by the nodes associated with
the edges, followed by the nodes associated with the quadrangular faces (if
any), followed by the nodes associated with the volume (if any). The
ordering of these additional nodes follows the ordering of the edges and
quadrangular faces given in @ref{Gmsh node ordering}.
@end table

Additional sections can be present in the file, which an external parser
can simply ignore. One such additional section
(@code{$PhysicalNames}-@code{$EndPhysicalNames}) associates names with
physical entity identification numbers:
@example
$PhysicalNames
@var{number-of-names}
@var{phyical-number} "@var{physical-name}"
$EndPhysicalNames

where
@table @code
@item @var{file-type}
is an integer equal to 1.

@item @var{data-size}
has the same meaning as in the ASCII file format. Currently only
@var{data-size} = sizeof(double) is supported.

@item @var{one-binary}
is an integer of value 1 written in binary form. This integer is used
for detecting if the computer on which the binary file was written and
the computer on which the file is read are of the same type (little or
big endian).

Here is a pseudo C code to write @var{one-binary}:
@example
int one = 1;
fwrite(&one, sizeof(int), 1, file);
@end example

@item @var{number-of-nodes}
has the same meaning as in the ASCII file format.

@item @var{nodes-binary}
is the list of nodes in binary form, i.e., a array of
@var{number-of-nodes} * (4 + 3 * @var{data-size}) bytes. For each node,
the first 4 bytes contain the node number and the next (3 *
@var{data-size}) bytes contain the three floating point coordinates.

Here is a pseudo C code to write @var{nodes-binary}:
@example
for(i = 0; i < number_of_nodes; i++)@{
  fwrite(&num_i, sizeof(int), 1, file);
  double xyz[3] = @{node_i_x, node_i_y, node_i_z@};
  fwrite(&xyz, sizeof(double), 3, file);

@item @var{number-of-elements}
has the same meaning as in the ASCII file format.

@item @var{element-header-binary}
is a list of 3 integers in binary form, i.e., an array of (3 * 4) bytes:
the first four bytes contain the type of the elements that follow (same
as @var{elm-type} in the ASCII format), the next four contain the number
of elements that follow, and the last four contain the number of tags
per element (same as @var{number-of-tags} in the ASCII format).

Here is a pseudo C code to write @var{element-header-binary}:
@example
int header[3] = @{elm_type, num_elm_follow, num_tags@};
fwrite(&header, sizeof(int), 3, file);
@end example

@item @var{elements-binary}
is a list of elements in binary form, i.e., an array of ``number of
elements that follow'' * (4 + @var{number-of-tags} * 4 +
#@var{node-number-list} * 4) bytes. For each element, the first four
bytes contain the element number, the next (@var{number-of-tags} * 4)
contain the tags, and the last (#@var{node-number-list} * 4) contain the
node indices.

Here is a pseudo C code to write @var{elements-binary} for triangles
with the 3 standard tags (the physical and elementary regions, and the
mesh partition):
@example
for(i = 0; i < number_of_triangles; i++)@{
  int data[7] = @{num_i, physical, elementary, partition, 
                 node_i_1, node_i_2, node_i_3@};

@section Gmsh post-processing file formats

@cindex @file{.pos} file

Gmsh can read and write data sets in three different file formats: the
``parsed'', ``ASCII'' and ``binary'' file formats. The parsed format is the
oldest and most flexible, but also the slowest to read/write. The ASCII and
binary formats are less flexible but allow for faster read/write operations,
which is useful for (very) large data sets.

Gmsh can convert any format to any other, either in a script (cf. @code{Save
View} and @code{PostProcessing.Format} in @ref{Post-processing commands},
and @ref{Post-processing options}, respectively) or in the graphical user
interface (using the `View->Save As' menu).

@subsection Parsed post-processing file format

@cindex Post-processing, parsed file format
@cindex File format, post-processing, parsed
@cindex @file{.pos} file

Gmsh's oldest post-processing format (``parsed'') is read by Gmsh's script
parser (see also @ref{Post-processing commands}). You can thus, for example,
embed parsed post-processing views directly into your geometrical
descriptions (see, e.g., @ref{t4.geo}). 

The parsed format is very powerful, since all the values are
@var{expressions}, and it can be easily generated ``on-the-fly'', as there
is no header containing @emph{a priori} information on the size of the data
set. Its syntax is also very permissive, which makes it ideal for testing
purposes. Its main disadvantage resides in the overhead introduced by the
parser, which makes loading a view in parsed format slower than loading a
view in ASCII or binary format. This is only a disadvantage for very large
data sets, though.

A post-processing view in parsed format is defined as follows (there can be
one or more views in the same file):

@example
@group
View "@var{string}" @{
  < TIME @{ @var{expression-list} @}; >
  @var{type} ( @var{list-of-coords} ) @{ @var{list-of-values} @};
  @dots{}
@};
@end group
@end example

where the 47 object @w{@var{type}s} that can be displayed are:

@example
                                 @var{type}  #@var{list-of-coords}  #@var{list-of-values}

The coordinates are given `by node'@footnote{Beware that this is different
from the ordering of the node coordinates in the ASCII and binary
post-processing file formats.}, i.e.,

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{(@var{coord1}, @var{coord2}, @var{coord3})} for a point,
@item 
@code{(@var{coord1-node1}, @var{coord2-node1}, @var{coord3-node1},}@* 
@code{ @var{coord1-node2}, @var{coord2-node2}, @var{coord3-node2})} for a line,
@item

@code{ @var{coord1-node2}, @var{coord2-node2}, @var{coord3-node2},}@*
@code{ @var{coord1-node3}, @var{coord2-node3}, @var{coord3-node3})} for a triangle,
@item
etc.
@end itemize

The ordering of the nodes is given in @ref{Gmsh node ordering}. For second
order elements, the first order nodes are given first, followed by the nodes
associated with the edges, followed by the nodes associated with the
quadrangular faces (if any), followed by the nodes associated with the
volume (if any). The ordering of these additional nodes follows the ordering
of the edges and quadrangular faces given in @ref{Gmsh node ordering}.

The values are given by time step, by node and by component, i.e.:
@example
@var{comp1-node1-time1}, @var{comp2-node1-time1}, @var{comp3-node1-time1},
@var{comp1-node2-time1}, @var{comp2-node2-time1}, @var{comp3-node2-time1},
@var{comp1-node3-time1}, @var{comp2-node3-time1}, @var{comp3-node3-time1},
@var{comp1-node1-time2}, @var{comp2-node1-time2}, @var{comp3-node1-time2},
@var{comp1-node2-time2}, @var{comp2-node2-time2}, @var{comp3-node2-time2},
@var{comp1-node3-time2}, @var{comp2-node3-time2}, @var{comp3-node3-time2},
@dots{}
@end example

For the 2D text objects, the two first @w{@var{expression}s} in
@var{list-of-coords} give the X-Y position of the string in screen
coordinates, measured from the top-left corner of the window. If the first
(respectively second) @var{expression} is negative, the position is measured
from the right (respectively bottom) edge of the window. If the value of the
first (respectively second) @var{expression} is larger than 99999, the
string is centered horizontally (respectively vertically). If the third
@var{expression} is equal to zero, the text is aligned bottom-left and
displayed using the default font and size. Otherwise, the third
@var{expression} is converted into an integer whose eight lower bits give
the font size, whose eight next bits select the font (the index corresponds
to the position in the font menu in the GUI), and whose eight next bits
define the text alignment (0=bottom-left, 1=bottom-center, 2=bottom-right,
3=top-left, 4=top-center, 5=top-right, 6=center-left, 7=center-center,
8=center-right).

For the 3D text objects, the three first @w{@var{expression}s} in
@var{list-of-coords} give the XYZ position of the string in model (real
world) coordinates.  The fourth @var{expression} has the same meaning as the
third @var{expression} in 2D text objects.

For both 2D and 3D text objects, the @var{list-of-values} can contain an
arbitrary number of @w{@var{char-expression}s}.

The optional @code{TIME} list can contain a list of expressions giving the
value of the time (or any other variable) for which an evolution was saved.

where
@table @code
@item @var{file-type}
is an integer equal to 0 in the ASCII file format.

@item @var{data-size}
is an integer equal to the size of the floating point numbers used in the
file (usually, @var{data-size} = sizeof(double)).

@item @var{view-name}
is a string containing the name of the view (max. 256 characters).

@item @var{nb-time-steps}
is an integer giving the number of time steps in the view.

@item @var{nb-scalar-points}
@item @var{nb-vector-points}
@item @dots{}
are integers giving the number of scalar points, vector points, @dots{}, in
the view.

@item @var{nb-text2d}
@item @var{nb-text3d}
are integers giving the number of 2D and 3D text strings in the
view. 

@item @var{nb-text2d-chars}
@item @var{nb-text3d-chars}
are integers giving the total number of characters in the 2D and 3D strings.

@item @var{time-step-values}
is a list of @var{nb-time-steps} double precision numbers giving the value
of the time (or any other variable) for which an evolution was saved.

@item @var{scalar-point-value}
@item @var{vector-point-value}
@item @dots{}
are lists of double precision numbers giving the node coordinates and the
values associated with the nodes of the @var{nb-scalar-points} scalar
points, @var{nb-vector-points} vector points, @dots{}, for each of the
@var{time-step-values}.

For example, @var{vector-triangle-value} is defined as:
@example
@var{coord1-node1} @var{coord1-node2} @var{coord1-node3}
@var{coord2-node1} @var{coord2-node2} @var{coord2-node3}
@var{coord3-node1} @var{coord3-node2} @var{coord3-node3}

@var{comp1-node3-time1} @var{comp2-node3-time1} @var{comp3-node3-time1}
@var{comp1-node1-time2} @var{comp2-node1-time2} @var{comp3-node1-time2}
@var{comp1-node2-time2} @var{comp2-node2-time2} @var{comp3-node2-time2}
@var{comp1-node3-time2} @var{comp2-node3-time2} @var{comp3-node3-time2}
@dots{}
@end example

The ordering of the nodes is given in @ref{Gmsh node ordering}. For second
order elements, the first order nodes are given first, followed by the nodes
associated with the edges, followed by the nodes associated with the
quadrangular faces (if any), followed by the nodes associated with the
volume (if any). The ordering of these additional nodes follows the ordering
of the edges and quadrangular faces given in @ref{Gmsh node ordering}.

@item @var{text2d}
is a list of 4 double precision numbers:
@example
@var{coord1} @var{coord2} @var{style} @var{index}
@end example
where @var{coord1} and @var{coord2} give the X-Y position of the 2D string
in screen coordinates (measured from the top-left corner of the window) and
where @var{index} gives the starting index of the string in
@var{text2d-chars}. If @var{coord1} (respectively @var{coord2}) is negative,
the position is measured from the right (respectively bottom) edge of the
window. If @var{coord1} (respectively @var{coord2}) is larger than 99999,
the string is centered horizontally (respectively vertically).  If
@var{style} is equal to zero, the text is aligned bottom-left and displayed
using the default font and size. Otherwise, @var{style} is converted into an
integer whose eight lower bits give the font size, whose eight next bits
select the font (the index corresponds to the position in the font menu in
the GUI), and whose eight next bits define the text alignment
(0=bottom-left, 1=bottom-center, 2=bottom-right, 3=top-left, 4=top-center,
5=top-right, 6=center-left, 7=center-center, 8=center-right).

@item @var{text2d-chars}
is a list of @var{nb-text2d-chars} characters. Substrings are separated with
the null `@code{\0}' character.

@item @var{text3d}
is a list of 5 double precision numbers
@example
@var{coord1} @var{coord2} @var{coord3} @var{style} @var{index}
@end example
where @var{coord1}, @var{coord2} and @var{coord3} give the XYZ coordinates
of the string in model (real world) coordinates, @var{index} gives the
starting index of the string in @var{text3d-chars}, and @var{style} has the
same meaning as in @var{text2d}.

@item @var{text3d-chars}
is a list of @var{nb-text3d-chars} chars. Substrings are separated with the
null `@code{\0}' character.

@cindex Post-processing, binary file format
@cindex File format, post-processing, binary

The binary post-processing file format is the same as the ASCII file format
described in @ref{ASCII post-processing file format}, except that:

@enumerate
@item
@var{file-type} equals 1.
@item 
all lists of floating point numbers and characters are written in binary
format
@item
there is an additional integer, of value 1, written before
@var{time-step-values}. This integer is used for detecting if the computer
on which the binary file was written and the computer on which the file is
read are of the same type (little or big endian).
@end enumerate

Here is a pseudo C code to write a post-processing file in binary format:

@example
int one = 1;

fprintf(file, "$PostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "%g %d %d\n", 1.4, 1, sizeof(double));
fprintf(file, "$EndPostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "$View\n");
fprintf(file, "%s %d "
  "%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d "

fwrite(&one, sizeof(int), 1, file);
fwrite(time-step-values, sizeof(double), nb-time-steps, file);
fwrite(all-scalar-point-values, sizeof(double), ..., file);
...
fprintf(file, "\n$EndView\n");
@end example
In this pseudo-code, @var{all-scalar-point-values} is the array of double
precision numbers containing all the @var{scalar-point-value} lists, put one
after each other in order to form a long array of doubles. The principle is
the same for all other kinds of values.

@cindex Programming, notes

Gmsh was originally written in C, and later enhanced with various C++
additions. The resulting code is a hybrid C/C++ beast, hopefully not too
badly structured... The scripting language is parsed using Lex and Yacc
(actually, Flex and Bison), while the GUI relies on OpenGL for the 3D
graphics and FLTK for the widget set. See @uref{http://www.opengl.org},
@uref{http://www.mesa3d.org} and @uref{http://www.fltk.org} for more
information.

Gmsh's build system is based on autoconf, and should work on most modern
platforms providing standard compliant C and C++ compilers. Practical
notes on how to compile Gmsh's source code are included in the
distribution. See @ref{Frequently asked questions}, for more
information.

If you plan to contribute code to the Gmsh project, here are some easy rules
to make the code easy to read/debug/maintain:

@enumerate
@item
please enable full warnings for your compiler (e.g., add @code{-Wall} to
@code{FLAGS} in the @file{variables} file);
@item
always use the @code{Msg()} function to print information, errors, @dots{};
@item 
indent your files using @file{utils/misc/indent.sh};

@node Option handling,  , Coding style, Programming notes
@section Option handling

To add a new option in Gmsh:

@enumerate
@item
create the option in the @code{Context_T} class (@file{Common/Context.h}) if
it's a classical option, or in the @code{Post_View} class
(@file{Common/View.h}) if it's a post-processing view-dependent option;
@item
in @file{Common/DefaultOptions.h}, give a name (for the parser to be able to
access it), a reference to a handling routine (i.e. @code{opt_XXX}) and a
default value for this option;
@item
create the handling routine @code{opt_XXX} in @file{Common/Options.cpp} (and
add the prototype in @file{Common/Options.h});
@item
optional: create the associated widget in @file{Fltk/GUI.cpp};
@item
optional: if no special callback is to be associated with the widget, add the
handling routine @code{opt_XXX} to the OK callback for the corresponding
option panel (in @file{Fltk/Callbacks.cpp}).

@itemize @bullet
@item
Install the `info' version of this user's guide! On your (Unix) system, this
can be achieved by

@enumerate
@item
copying all @file{gmsh.info*} files to the place where your info files live
(usually @file{/usr/info}), and
@item
issuing the command @code{install-info /usr/info/gmsh.info /usr/info/dir}.
@end enumerate

You will then be able to access the documentation with the command
@code{info gmsh}. Note that particular sections (`nodes') can be accessed
directly. For example, @code{info gmsh surfaces} or @code{info gmsh surf}
will take you directly to @ref{Surfaces}.
@item
Use emacs to edit your files, and load the C++ mode! This permits automatic
syntax highlighting and easy indentation. Automatic loading of the C++ mode
for @file{.geo} files can be achieved by adding the following command in
your @code{.emacs} file: @code{(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.geo$"
. c++-mode)) auto-mode-alist))}.
@item
Define common geometrical objects and options in separate files, reusable in
all your problem definition structures.
@item
Save your preferred options with `Tools->Options->Save as defaults'. To
reset the default options, erase the @code{General.OptionsFileName}
(usually @file{.gmsh-options} in your home directory) or use the
`Restore default options' button in `Tools->Options->General->Output'.
@item
In the graphical user interface:

@itemize --
@item
dragging the mouse in a numeric input field slides the value. The left
button moves one step per pixel, the middle by 10 * step, and the right
button by 100 * step;
