@chapter Overview

@cindex Introduction
@cindex Overview

Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator,
primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Its
primal design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
cases with parametric input and up to date visualization capabilities.  One
of its strengths is the ability to respect a characteristic length field for
the generation of adapted meshes on lines, surfaces and volumes, and to mix
these meshes with simple structured (transfinite, extruded, etc.) grids.

Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
post-processing. All geometrical, mesh, solver and post-processing
instructions are prescribed either interactively using the graphical user
interface (GUI) or in ASCII data files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
Interactive actions generate language bits in the input files, and vice
versa. This makes it possible to automate all treatments, using loops,
conditionals and external system calls. A brief description of the four
modules is given hereafter.

@c Geometry: geometrical entity definition
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Geometry, Mesh, Overview, Overview
@section Geometry: geometrical entity definition

Geometries are created in a bottom-up flow by successively defining points,
oriented curves (line segments, circles, ellipses, splines,@w{ }@dots{}),
oriented surfaces (plane surfaces, ruled surfaces,@w{ }@dots{}) and
volumes. Compound groups of geometrical entities can be defined, based on
these elementary geometric entities. Gmsh's scripting language allows all
geometrical entities to be fully parameterized.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Mesh: finite element mesh generation
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Mesh, Solver, Geometry, Overview
@section Mesh: finite element mesh generation

A finite element mesh is a tessellation of a given subset of the
three-dimensional space by elementary geometrical elements of various shapes
(in Gmsh's case: lines, triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra, prisms,
hexahedra and pyramids), arranged in such a way that if two of them
intersect, they do so along a face, an edge or a node, and never
otherwise. All the finite element meshes produced by Gmsh as unstructured,
even if they were generated in a structured way (e.g. by extrusion). This
implies that the elementary geometrical elements are defined only by an
ordered list of their vertices but no predefined relation is assumed between
any two elements.

The mesh generation is performed in the same order as the geometry creation:
curves are discretized first; the mesh of the curves is then used to mesh
the surfaces; then the mesh of the surfaces is used to mesh the
volumes. This automatically assures the conformity of the mesh when, for
example, two surfaces share a common curve. Every meshing step is
constrained by the characteristic length field, which can be uniform,
specified by characteristic lengths associated with elementary geometrical
entities, or associated with another mesh (the background mesh).

For each meshing step (i.e. the discretization of lines, surfaces and
volumes), all structured mesh directives are executed first, and serve
as additional constraints for the unstructured parts. The implemented
Delaunay algorithm is subdivided in the following five steps for
surface/volume discretization:

@enumerate
@item
trivial meshing of a box including the convex polygon/polyhedron defined by
the boundary nodes resulting from the discretization of the curves/surfaces;
@item
creation of the initial mesh by insertion of all the nodes on the
curves/surfaces thanks to the Bowyer algorithm;
@item
boundary restoration to force all the edges/faces of the curves/surfaces to
be present in the initial mesh;
@item
suppression of all the unwanted triangles/tetrahedra (in particular those
containing the nodes of the initial box);
@item
insertion of new nodes by the Bowyer algorithm until the characteristic size
of each simplex is lower or equal to the characteristic length field
evaluated at the center of its circumscribed circle/sphere.
@end enumerate

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Solver: external solver interface
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Solver, Post-processing, Mesh, Overview
@section Solver: external solver interface

External solvers can be interfaced with Gmsh through Unix sockets, which
permits to easily launch external computations and to collect and exploit
the simulation results within Gmsh's post-processing module. The default
solver interfaced with Gmsh is GetDP
(@uref{http://www.geuz.org/getdp/}).

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Post-processing, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Solver, Overview
@section Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization

Multiple post-processing scalar, vector or tensor maps can be loaded and
manipulated (globally or individually) along with the geometry and the
mesh. Scalar fields are represented by iso-value curves/surfaces or color
maps, while vector and tensor fields are represented by three-dimensional
arrows or displacement maps. Post-processing functions include arbitrary
section computation, offset, elevation, boundary extraction, color map and
range modification, animation, vector graphic output, etc. All
post-processing options can be accessed either interactively or through the
input ASCII text files. Scripting permits to automate all post-processing
operations, e.g. for the creation of animations. User-defined operations can
also be performed on post-processing views through dynamically loadable
plugins.

@node What Gmsh is pretty good at, and what Gmsh is not so good at, Post-processing, Overview
@section What Gmsh is pretty good at @dots{}

Gmsh is a (relatively) small program, and was principally developed ``in
academia, to solve academic problems''@dots{} Nevertheless, over the
years, many people outside universities have found Gmsh useful in their
day-to-day jobs. So here is a tentative list of what Gmsh does best:

@itemize @bullet
@item
quickly describe simple and/or ``repetitive'' geometries, thanks to
user-defined functions, loops, conditionals and includes (see
@ref{User-defined functions}, @ref{Loops and conditionals}, and @ref{General
commands});
@item
parameterize these geometries. Gmsh's scripting language permits all
commands and command arguments to depend on previous calculations (see
@ref{Expressions} and @ref{Geometry commands});
@item
generate 1D, 2D and 3D simplicial (i.e. using line segments, triangles and
tetrahedra) finite element meshes. The performance of the 1D and 2D
algorithms is pretty good; the 3D algorithm is still somewhat experimental
and slow (see @ref{Mesh module} and @ref{Tutorial});
@item
specify target element sizes accurately. Gmsh provides several mechanisms to
control the size of the elements in the final mesh: through interpolation
from geometrical point characteristic lengths or geometrical attractors, or
from user-defined background meshes (@pxref{Mesh commands});
@item
create simple extruded geometries and meshes (see @ref{Geometry commands}
and @ref{Mesh commands});
@item
interact with external solvers. Gmsh provides C/C++ and Perl interfaces, and
others can be easily added (@pxref{Solver});
@item
visualize computational results in a great variety of ways. Gmsh can display
scalar, vector and tensor data sets, and can perform various operations on
the resulting post-processing views (@pxref{Post-processing});
@item
export plots in many different formats: vector PostScript or encapsulated
PostScript, LaTeX, PNG, JPEG,@w{ }@dots{} (@pxref{General options});
@item
generate complex animations (see @ref{General tools} and @ref{t8.geo});
@item
run on low end machines and/or machines with no graphic system. Gmsh can be
compiled with or without the graphical user interface, and all versions can
be used either interactively or not, directly from the command line
(@pxref{Running Gmsh});
@item
configure your preferred options. Gmsh has a large number of configurations
options that can be set interactively using the GUI, scattered inside
command files, changed on the fly in scripts, set in per-user configuration
files, or specified on the command-line (see @ref{General options},
@ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Post-processing options}
and @ref{Running Gmsh});
@item
and do all the above on various platforms (Windows, Mac and Unix), for free
(@pxref{Copying conditions}), using clear-text ASCII files and/or a small
but powerful graphical user interface.
@end itemize

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c ... and what Gmsh is not so good at
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node and what Gmsh is not so good at, Syntactic rules, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Overview
@section @dots{} and what Gmsh is not so good at

Due to its historical background and limited developer manpower, Gmsh has
also some (a lot of?) weaknesses:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the bottom-up approach for describing geometries can become impractical for
complex models;
@item
there is no support for NURBS and only very limited support for trimmed
surfaces;
@item
Gmsh is not primarily a structured mesh generator: no automatic
quadrilateral or hexahedral meshing algorithm is provided. If you want
quadrangles, you have to use transfinite or extruded meshes or recombine
unstructured triangular meshes. For hexahedra, your only choice is
transfinite or extruded meshes;
@item
Gmsh is not a multi-bloc generator: all meshes produced by Gmsh are
conforming in the sense of finite element meshes;
@item
there is not support for curved mesh elements as of this writing (Gmsh
1.44);
@item
Gmsh was designed to solve academic test-cases, not industrial-size
problems. You may find that Gmsh is too slow for large problems (with
thousands of geometric primitives, or millions of mesh/post-processing
elements).
@end itemize

gladly accept any code contributions (@pxref{Programming notes}) to remedy

@item 
Metasyntactic variables (i.e.@: text bits that are not part of the syntax,
but stand for other text bits) are printed like @var{this}.
@item 
A colon (@code{:}) after a metasyntactic variable separates the variable
from its definition.
@item 
Optional rules are enclosed in @code{<} @code{>} pairs.
@item 
Multiple choices are separated by @code{|}.
@item

@chapter General tools

This chapter describes the general commands and options that can be used in
Gmsh's ASCII text input files. By ``general'', we mean ``not specifically
related to one of the geometry, mesh, solver or post-processing
modules''. Commands peculiar to these modules will be introduced in
@ref{Geometry module}, @ref{Mesh module}, @ref{Solver module} and
@ref{Post-processing module}, respectively.

Note that, if you are just beginning to use Gmsh, or just want to see what
Gmsh is all about, you really don't need to read this chapter and the four
next ones. Just have a quick look at @ref{Running Gmsh}, and go play with
the graphical user interface, running the tutorials and demonstration files
bundled in the distribution! Most of the commands and options described in
the following chapters are available interactively in the GUI, so you don't
need to worry about Gmsh's internals for creating your first geometries,
meshes and post-processing plots. Once you master the tutorial (read the
source files: they are heavily commented---see @ref{Tutorial}), you might
want to come back here to learn more about the specific syntax of Gmsh's
commands and esoteric options.

@cindex Expression, definition
@cindex Constant, definition

The two constant types used in Gmsh are @var{real} and @var{string} (there
is no integer type).  These types have the same meaning and syntax as in the
C or C++ programming languages.

@node Floating point expressions, Character expressions, Expressions, Expressions
@subsection Floating point expressions

@cindex Expression, floating point
@cindex Real numbers
@cindex Numbers, real
@cindex Floating point numbers

Floating point expressions (or, more simply, ``expressions'') are denoted by
the metasyntactic variable @var{expression} (remember the definition of the
syntactic rules in @ref{Syntactic rules}), and are evaluated during the
parsing of the data file:

@example
@var{expression}:
  @var{real} |
  @var{expression-id} |
  @var{operator-unary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-left} @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-right} @var{expression} |
  @var{built-in-function}
@end example

Such @w{@var{expression}s} are used in most of Gmsh's commands. The
operators @var{operator-unary}, @var{operator-binary} and
@var{operator-ternary-left}/@var{operator-ternary-right} are defined in
@ref{Operators}. For the definition of @w{@var{built-in-function}s}, see
@ref{Built-in functions}.

@cindex Expression, lists
@cindex Number, lists

List of expressions are also widely used, and are defined as:

@example
@var{expression-list}:
  @var{expression-list-item} <, @var{expression-list-item}> @dots{}
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-list-item}:
  @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression-id} @{@} |
  @var{expression-id} @{ @var{expression-list} @}
@end example

The second case in this last definition permits to create a list containing
the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s}, with a
unit incrementation step. The third case also permits to create a list
containing the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s},
but with a positive or negative incrementation step equal to the third
@var{expression}. The fourth case permits to reference an expression list.
The last case permits to reference an expression sublist (whose elements are
those corresponding to the indices provided by the
@var{expression-list}). To see the practical use of such expressions, have a
look at the first couple of examples in @ref{Tutorial}.

@cindex Expression, affectation
@cindex Expression, identifier

@findex =
@findex +=
@findex -=
@findex *=
@findex /=

The syntax for the definition of a new expression identifier is:

@example
@var{expression-id} = @var{expression-def};
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-id}:
  @var{string} |
  @var{real-option}
@end example

@noindent and

@example
@var{expression-def}:
  @var{expression-list-item} |
  @{ @var{expression-list} @}
@end example

The various @w{@var{real-option}s} are listed in @ref{General options},
@ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Solver options}, and
@ref{Post-processing options}. In addition to the @w{@var{real-option}s},
eight @w{@var{expression-id}s} are predefined (hard coded in Gmsh's parser):
@ftable @code
@item Pi
Returns 3.1415926535897932.

@item MPI_Size
Returns the number of processors on which Gmsh is running (always 1, except
if you compiled Gmsh's parallel extensions).

@item MPI_Rank
Returns the rank of the current processor.

@item newp
Returns the next available point number. As we will see in @ref{Geometry
module}, a unique number is associated with every geometrical point:
@code{newp} permits to know the highest number already attributed. This is
most useful when writing user-defined functions (@pxref{User-defined
functions}) or general geometric primitives, when one does not know a priori
which numbers are already attributed, and which ones are still available.

@item newl
Returns the next available curve number.

@item news
Returns the next available surface number.

@item newv
Returns the next available volume number.

@item newreg
Returns the next available region number. That is, @code{newreg} returns the
maximum of @code{newp}, @code{newc}, @code{news}, @code{newv} and all
physical entity numbers@footnote{For compatibility purposes, the behavior
of @code{newc}, @code{news}, @code{newv} and @code{newreg} can be modified
with the @code{Geometry.OldNewReg} option (@pxref{Geometry options}).}.
@end ftable

One can also perform additions, subtractions, multiplications ands divisions
while affecting a value to an existing @var{expression-id}, using:

@example
@var{expression-id} += @var{expression-def};
@var{expression-id} -= @var{expression-def};
@var{expression-id} *= @var{expression-def};
@end example

@noindent and

@example
@var{expression-id} /= @var{expression-def};

@cindex Expression, character
@cindex Strings

Character expressions are defined as:

@example
@var{expression-char}:
  "@var{string}" |
  StrPrefix ( @var{expression-char} ) |
  StrCat ( @var{expression-char} , @var{expression-char} ) |
  Sprintf ( @var{expression-char} , @var{expression-list} )
@end example

@noindent The second case in this definition permits to take the
prefix of a string (e.g. for removing the extension from a file name). The
third case permits to concatenate two character expressions, and the fifth
is an equivalent of the @code{sprintf} C function (where
@var{expression-char} is a format string that can contain floating point
formatting characters: @code{%e}, @code{%g}, etc.).

Character expressions are mostly used to specify non-numeric options and
input/output file names. See @ref{t8.geo}, for an interesting usage of
@w{@var{expression-char}s} in an animation script. Although there exists no
character expression identifier, @w{@var{expression-char}s} can be affected
to @w{@var{string-option}s}:

@example
@var{string-option} = @var{expression-char};
@end example

The various @w{@var{string-option}s} are listed in @ref{General options},
@ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Solver options}, and

@cindex Colors

Colors expressions are hybrids between fixed-length bracketed
@w{@var{expression-list}s} and a @w{@var{string}s}:

@example
@var{expression-color}:
  @var{string} |
  @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @} |
  @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @}
@end example

@noindent The first case permits to use the X Windows names to refer to colors,
e.g. @code{Red}, @code{SpringGreen}, @code{LavenderBlush3},@w{ }@dots{} (see
@file{Common/Colors.h} in the sources). The second case permits to define
colors by using three expressions to specify their red, green and blue
components (with values comprised between 0 and 255). The last case permits
to define colors by using the red, green, blue color components as well as
the alpha channel. See @ref{t3.geo}, for an example of the use of color
expressions.

Although there exists no color expression identifier,
@w{@var{expression-color}s} can be affected to @w{@var{color-option}s}:

@example
@var{color-option} = @var{expression-color};
@end example

The various @w{@var{color-option}s} are listed in @ref{General options},

User-defined functions take no arguments, and are evaluated as if a file
containing the function body was included at the location of the @code{Call}
statement.

@ftable @code

@item Function @var{string}
Begins the declaration of a user-defined function named @var{string}. The
body of the function starts on the line after `@code{Function
@var{string}}', and can contain any Gmsh command.

@item Return

Loops and conditionals are defined as follows, and can be imbricated:

@ftable @code
@item For ( @var{expression} : @var{expression} )
Iterates from the value of the first @var{expression} to the value of the
second @var{expression}, with a unit incrementation step. At each iteration,
the commands comprised between the @code{For} and the matching @code{EndFor}
tags are executed.

@item For ( @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} )
Iterates from the value of the first @var{expression} to the value of the
second @var{expression}, with a positive or negative incrementation step
equal to the third @var{expression}. At each iteration, the commands
comprised between the @code{For} and the matching @code{EndFor} tags are
executed.

@item For @var{string} In ( @var{expression} : @var{expression} )
Iterates from the value of the first @var{expression} to the value of the
second @var{expression}, with a unit incrementation step. At each iteration,
the value of the iterate is affected to an expression named @var{string},
and the commands comprised between the @code{For} and the matching
@code{EndFor} tags are executed.

@item For @var{string} In ( @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} )
Iterates from the value of the first @var{expression} to the value of the
second @var{expression}, with a positive or negative incrementation step
equal to the third @var{expression}. At each iteration, the value of the
iterate is affected to an expression named @var{string}, and the commands
comprised between the @code{For} and the matching @code{EndFor} tags are
executed.

@item EndFor
Ends a matching @code{For} command.

@item If ( @var{expression} )
The body enclosed between @code{If ( @var{expression} )} and the matching
@code{Endif} is evaluated if @var{expression} is non-zero.

@item EndIf
Ends a matching @code{If} command.
@end ftable

@section General commands

The following commands can be used anywhere in a Gmsh script:

@ftable @code

@item Exit;
Aborts the current script.

@item Printf ( @var{expression-char} , @var{expression-list} );
Prints strings in the information window and/or on the
terminal. @code{Printf} is equivalent to the @code{printf} C function:
@var{expression-char} is a format string that can contain formatting
characters (@code{%f}, @code{%e}, etc.). Note that all @w{@var{expression}s}
are evaluated as floating point values in Gmsh (@pxref{Expressions}), so
that only valid floating point formatting characters make sens in
@var{expression-char}. @xref{t5.geo}, for an example of the use of
@code{Printf}.

@item Merge @var{expression-char};
Merges a file named @var{expression-char}. This command is equivalent to the
`File->Merge' menu in the graphical user interface. If the path in
@var{expression-char} is not absolute, @var{expression-char} is appended to
the directory where the current opened project resides.

@item MergeWithBoundingBox @var{expression-char};
Merges a file and force the recalculation of the scene's bounding box.

@item Draw;
Redraws the scene.

@item Save @var{expression-char};
Saves the mesh in a file named @var{expression-char}, using the current
@code{Mesh.Format} (@pxref{Mesh options}).

@item Print @var{expression-char};
Prints the graphic window in a file named @var{expression-char}, using the
current @code{Print.Format} (@pxref{General options}).

@item Sleep @var{expression};
Suspends the execution of Gmsh during @var{expression} seconds.

@item Delete View[@var{expression}];
Delete (removes) the @var{expression}-th post-processing view. View
numbers start at zero.

@item Delete Meshes;
Deletes all currently loaded meshes.

@item Duplicata View[@var{expression}];
Duplicates the @var{expression}-th post-processing view. View
numbers start at zero.

@item System @var{expression-char};
Executes a system call.

@item Include @var{expression-char};
@item #include @var{expression-char};
Includes the file named @var{expression-char} at the current position in
the input file. The @code{Include} commands should given on a line of their
own.

Here is the list of the general @w{@var{string-option}s},
@w{@var{real-option}s} and @w{@var{color-option}s} (in that order---check
the default values to see the types). Most of these options are accessible
in the graphical user interface, but not all of them. When running Gmsh
interactively, changing an option in the ASCII text input file will modify
the option in the GUI in real time. This permits for example to resize the
graphical window in a script, or to interact with animations in the script
and in the GUI at the same time.

Gmsh's default behavior is to save some of these options in a per-user
``session resource'' file (@code{General.SessionFileName}) each time Gmsh is
shut down. This permits for example to automatically remember the size and
location of the windows or which fonts to use. Other options can be saved in
a per-user ``option'' file (@code{General.OptionsFileName}), automatically
loaded by Gmsh during startup, by using the `Tools->Options->Save' menu.

There are several different ways to actually run Gmsh on your
computer@footnote{Note that these operation modes can slightly vary
depending on the operating system and/or shell you use.} The first working
mode of Gmsh is the interactive graphical mode. To launch Gmsh in
interactive mode, just click or double-click on the Gmsh icon (Windows and
Mac), or type

@example
> gmsh
@end example

@noindent at your shell prompt on the command line (Unix). This will open
two windows: the graphic window (with a status bar at the bottom) and the
menu window (with a menu bar and some context dependent buttons). To open
the first tutorial file, select the `File->Open' menu, and choose
@file{t1.geo} in the input field. To perform the mesh generation, go to the
mesh module (by selecting `Mesh' in the module menu) and choose the required
dimension in the context-dependent buttons (`1D' will mesh all the curves;
`2D' will mesh all the surfaces---as well as all the curves if `1D' was not
called before; `3D' will mesh all the volumes---and all the surfaces if `2D'
was not called before). To save the resulting mesh in the current mesh
format, choose `Save' in the context-dependent buttons, or select the
appropriate format with the `File->Save as' menu. The default mesh file name
is based on the name of the first input file on the command line (or
@file{untitled} if there wasn't any input file given), with an appended
extension depending on the mesh format.

Note that nearly all the interactive commands have shortcuts: see
@ref{Keyboard shortcuts} or select `Help->Shortcuts' in the menu bar to
learn about these.

Instead of opening the tutorial with the `File->Open' menu, it is
often more convenient to put the file name on the command line, for
example with:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo
@end example

Note that, even if it is often handy to define the variables and the points
directly in the input files (you may use any text editor for this purpose,
e.g. Wordpad on Windows, or Emacs on Unix), it is almost always more simple
to define the curves, the surfaces and the volumes interactively. To do so,
just follow the context dependent buttons in the Geometry module. For
example, to create a spline, select `Geometry' in the module menu, and then
select `Elementary, Add, New, Spline'. You will then be asked (in the status
bar of the graphic window) to select a list of points, and to type @kbd{e} to
finish the selection (or @kbd{q} to abort it). Once the interactive command is
completed, a string is automatically added at the end of the currently
opened project file.

The second operating mode for Gmsh is the non-interactive mode. In this
mode, there is no graphical user interface, and all operations are performed
without any user interaction@footnote{If you compile Gmsh without the
graphical user interface, i.e. with @code{./configure --disable-gui}, this
is the only mode you;ll have access to.}. To mesh the first tutorial in
non-interactive mode, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2
@end example

To mesh the same example, but with the background mesh available in the file
@file{bgmesh.pos}, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2 -bgm bgmesh.pos
@end example

You should read the notes in the file @file{bgmesh.pos} if you intend to use
background meshes.

Several files can be loaded simultaneously in Gmsh. The first one defines
the project, while the others are appended ("merged") to this project. You
can merge such files with the `File->Merge' menu, or by directly specifying
the names of the files on the command line. This is most useful for
post-processing purposes. For example, to merge the post-processing views
contained in the files @file{view1.pos} and @file{view2.pos} together with
the first tutorial @file{t1.geo}, you can type the following command:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo view1.pos view2.pos
@end example

In the Post-Processing module (select `Post_Processing' in the module
menu), two view buttons will appear, respectively labeled "a scalar
map" and "a vector map". A mouse click on the name will toggle the
visibility of the selected view, while a click on the arrow button on
the right will provide access to the view's options. If you want the
modifications made to one view to affect also all the other views,
select the `Apply next changes to all views' or `Force same options
for all views' option in the `Tools->Options->Post-processing' menu.

Note that all the options specified interactively can also be directly
specified in the ASCII input files. All available options, with their
current values, can be saved into a file by selecting `File->Save as->Gmsh
options', or simply viewed by pressing the `?' button in the status bar. To
save the current options as your default preferences for all future Gmsh
sessions, use the `Tools->Options->Save' button.

This chapter describes the file formats that cannot be modified by the
user. These format have a version number (currently 1.2), independent of the
Gmsh version number (currently @value{GMSH-VERSION}).

All non-parsed file formats have sections enclosed between @code{$KEY} and
@code{$ENDKEY} symbol pairs.

@cindex Mesh, file format
@cindex @file{.msh} file

The @file{.msh} file format is Gmsh's native mesh file format. The file is
divided into two sections, defining the nodes (@code{NOD}-@code{ENDNOD}) and
the elements (@code{ELM}-@code{ENDELM}) in the mesh:

@example
$NOD
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
@dots{}
$ENDNOD
$ELM
@var{number-of-elements}
@var{elm-number} @var{elm-type} @var{reg-phys} @var{reg-elemem} @var{number-of-nodes} @var{node-number-list}
@dots{}
$ENDELM
@end example

@noindent
where
@table @code
@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes in the mesh

@item @var{node-number}
is the number (index) of the n-th node in the mesh. Note that the
@w{@var{node-number}s} should not necessarily given in a consecutive (or
even an ordered) way.

@item @var{x-coord}
@item @var{y-coord}
@item @var{z-coord}
are the floating point values giving the X, Y and Z coordinate of the n-th
node.

@item @var{number-of-elements}
is the number of elements in the mesh

@item @var{elm-number}
is the number (index) of the n-th element in the mesh. Note that the
@w{@var{elm-number}s} should not necessarily given in a consecutive (or even
an ordered) way.

@item @var{elm-type}
defines the geometrical type for the n-th element:
@table @code
@item 1
Line (2 nodes, 1 edge).
@item 2
Triangle (3 nodes, 3 edges).
@item 3
Quadrangle (4 nodes, 4 edges).
@item 4
Tetrahedron (4 nodes, 6 edges, 4 facets).
@item 5
Hexahedron (8 nodes, 12 edges, 6 facets).
@item 6
Prism (6 nodes, 9 edges, 5 facets).
@item 7
Pyramid (5 nodes, 8 edges, 5 facets).
@item 15
Point (1 node).
@end table

@item @var{reg-phys}
is the number of the physical entity to which the element belongs. 

@item @var{reg-elem}
is the number of the elementary entity to which the element belongs.

@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes for the n-th element. This is redundant, but kept for
backward compatibility reasons. The redundancy may disappear in the future
if higher order elements are implemented using the same @w{@var{elm-type}s}
as the current ones.

@item @var{node-number-list}
is a list of @var{number-of-nodes} node numbers (separated by white space,
without commas).

The binary post-processing file format is the same as the ASCII file format
described in @ref{Gmsh ASCII post-processing file format}, except that:

@enumerate
@item
@var{file-type} equals 1.
@item 
all lists of floating point numbers and characters are written in binary

@item
there is an additional integer, of value 1, written before
time-step-values. This integer is used for detecting if the computer on
which the binary file was written and the computer on which the file is read
are of the same type (little or big endian).
@end enumerate

Here is a pseudo C code to write the beginning of a post-processing
file in binary format:

@example
int one = 1;

fprintf(file, "$PostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "%g %d %d\n", 1.2, 1, sizeof(double));
fprintf(file, "$EndPostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "$View\n");

  nb-text2d, nb-text2d-chars, nb-text3d, nb-text3d-chars);
fwrite(&one, sizeof(int), 1, file);
fwrite(time-step-values, sizeof(double), nb-time-steps, file);
fwrite(all-scalar-point-values, sizeof(double), ..., file);
...
fprintf(file, "\n$EndView\n");
@end example
In this pseudo-code, @var{all-scalar-point-values} is the array of double
precision numbers containing all the @var{scalar-point-value} lists, put one
after each other in order to form a long array of doubles. The principle is
the same for all other kinds of values.

@cindex Post-processing, parsed file format
@cindex @file{.pos} file

For relatively small data sets Gmsh provides an additional post-processing
format, which is parsed by the same grammar analyzer as the Gmsh script
language. You can thus, for example, embed small post-processing views
directly into your geometrical descriptions (see e.g. @ref{t4.geo}). This
format is also useful for testing purposes: its syntax is very permissive,
and you can easily generate it by hand or on the fly. The format of the
parsed post-processing file is the following:

@example
View "@var{string}" @{
  @var{type} ( @var{list-of-coords} ) @{ @var{list-of-values} @};
  @dots{}
@};
@end example

The same 26 base objects can be displayed as in the ASCII or binary
post-processing file formats:

But, for historical reasons, contrary to the ASCII and binary

@item 
@code{(coord1-node1, coord2-node1, coord3-node1,}@*

@item 
@code{(coord1-node1, coord2-node1, coord3-node1,}@*
@code{ coord1-node2, coord2-node2, coord3-node2,}@*
@code{ coord1-node3, coord2-node3, coord3-node3)} for a triangle,

This is section is not yet written: see @file{utils/README.devel}.

@c The code itself is in C++, but most of it was initially written in C (hence
@c the hybrid code style...). The analysis of the syntax is performed by Lex
@c and Yacc.

@c All graphics are rendered using OpenGL (@uref{http://www.opengl.org}). A
@c free replacement for OpenGL can be found at @uref{http://www.mesa3d.org}.

@c The user interface is based on the FLTK widget set
@c (@uref{http://www.fltk.org}).

@c Build system based on autoconf. Should we add a chapter/section on how to
@c compile Gmsh? Compiling the Windows version requires the Cygwin tools
@c (freely available from @uref{http://www.cygwin.com}).

If you think you have found a bug in Gmsh, you can report it by electronic
mail to the Gmsh mailing list at @email{gmsh@@geuz.org}.  Please send as
precise a description of the problem as you can, including sample input
files that produce the bug (problem definition and mesh files). Don't forget
to mention both the version of Gmsh and the version of your operation
system (@pxref{Running Gmsh} to see how to get this information).

See the @file{TODO} file in the distribution to check the problems we
already know about.

Install the `info' version of this user's guide! On your (Unix) system, this
can be achieved by 1) copying all gmsh.info* files to the place where your
info files live (usually /usr/info), and 2) issuing the command
`install-info /usr/info/gmsh.info /usr/info/dir'. You will then be able to
access the documentation with the command `info gmsh'. Note that particular
sections ("nodes") can be accessed directly. For example, `info gmsh
contributors' will take you directly to @ref{Contributors}.
@item
Use emacs to edit your files, and load the C++ mode! This permits automatic
syntax highlighting and easy indentation. Automatic loading of the C++ mode
for @file{.geo} files can be achieved by adding the following command in
your @code{.emacs} file: @code{(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.geo$"
. c++-mode)) auto-mode-alist))}.
@item
Define common geometrical objects and options in separate files, reusable in
all your problem definition structures.
@item
Save your preferred options with `Tools->Options->Save'. To reset default
options, erase the @code{General.OptionsFileName} (usually
@file{.gmsh-options} in your home directory) or use the `Restore default
options' button in `Tools->Options->General->Output'.
