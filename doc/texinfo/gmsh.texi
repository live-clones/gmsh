@chapter Overview

@cindex Introduction
@cindex Overview

Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator,
primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Its
primal design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
cases with parametric input and up to date visualization capabilities.  One
of its strengths is the ability to respect a characteristic length field for
the generation of adapted meshes on lines, surfaces and volumes, and to mix
these meshes with simple structured (transfinite, extruded, etc.) grids.

Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
post-processing. All geometrical, mesh, solver and post-processing
instructions are prescribed either interactively using the graphical user
interface (GUI) or in ASCII data files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
Interactive actions generate language bits in the input files, and vice
versa. This makes it possible to automate all treatments, using loops,
conditionals and external system calls. A brief description of the four
modules is given hereafter.

@c Geometry: geometrical entity definition
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Geometry, Mesh, Overview, Overview
@section Geometry: geometrical entity definition

Geometries are created in a bottom-up flow by successively defining points,
oriented lines (line segments, circles, ellipses, splines,@w{ }@dots{}),
oriented surfaces (plane surfaces, ruled surfaces,@w{ }@dots{}) and
volumes. Compound groups of geometrical entities can be defined, based on
these elementary geometric entities. Gmsh's scripting language allows all
geometrical entities to be fully parameterized.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Mesh: finite element mesh generation
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Mesh, Solver, Geometry, Overview
@section Mesh: finite element mesh generation

A finite element mesh is a tessellation of a given subset of the
three-dimensional space by elementary geometrical elements of various shapes
(in Gmsh's case: lines, triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra, prisms,
hexahedra and pyramids), arranged in such a way that if two of them
intersect, they do so along a face, an edge or a node, and never
otherwise. All the finite element meshes produced by Gmsh are considered as
``unstructured'', even if they were generated in a ``structured'' way
(e.g.@: by extrusion). This implies that the elementary geometrical elements
are defined only by an ordered list of their nodes but that no predefined
order relation is assumed between any two elements.

The mesh generation is performed in the same bottom-up flow as the geometry
creation: lines are discretized first; the mesh of the lines is then used to
mesh the surfaces; then the mesh of the surfaces is used to mesh the
volumes. In this process, the mesh of an entity is only constrained by the
mesh of its boundary@footnote{For example, in three dimensions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the triangles discretizing a surface will be forced to be faces of
tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only if the surface is part of the boundary
of a volume;
@item
the line elements discretizing a curve will be forced to be edges of
tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only if the curve is part of the boundary of
a surface, itself part of the boundary of a volume;
@item
a single node discretizing a point in the middle of a volume will be forced
to be a vertex of one of the tetrahedra in the final 3D mesh only if this
point is connected to a curve, itself part of the boundary of a surface,
itself part of the boundary of a volume...
@end itemize
}. This automatically assures the conformity of the mesh when, for example,
two surfaces share a common line. But this also implies that the
discretization of an ``isolated'' (@var{n}-1)-th dimensional entity inside
an @var{n}-th dimensional entity does @emph{not} constrain the @var{n}-th
dimensional mesh.  Every meshing step is constrained by the characteristic
length field, which can be uniform, specified by characteristic lengths
associated with elementary geometrical entities, or associated with another
mesh (the background mesh).

For each meshing step, all structured mesh directives are executed first,
and serve as additional constraints for the unstructured parts. The
implemented Delaunay algorithm is subdivided in the following five steps for
surface/volume discretization:

@enumerate
@item
trivial meshing of a box including the convex polygon/polyhedron defined by
the boundary nodes resulting from the discretization of the lines/surfaces;
@item
creation of the initial mesh by insertion of all the nodes on the
lines/surfaces thanks to the Bowyer algorithm;
@item
boundary restoration to force all the edges/faces of the lines/surfaces to
be present in the initial mesh;
@item
suppression of all the unwanted triangles/tetrahedra (in particular those
containing the nodes of the initial box);
@item
insertion of new nodes by the Bowyer algorithm until the characteristic size
of each simplex is lower or equal to the characteristic length field
evaluated at the center of its circumscribed circle/sphere.
@end enumerate

@c Solver: external solver interface
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Solver, Post-processing, Mesh, Overview
@section Solver: external solver interface

External solvers can be interfaced with Gmsh through Unix sockets, which
permits to easily launch external computations and to collect and exploit
the simulation results within Gmsh's post-processing module. The default
solver interfaced with Gmsh is GetDP
(@uref{http://www.geuz.org/getdp/}).

@c Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Post-processing, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Solver, Overview
@section Post-processing: scalar, vector and tensor field visualization

Multiple post-processing scalar, vector or tensor maps can be loaded and
manipulated (globally or individually) along with the geometry and the
mesh. Scalar fields are represented by iso-value lines/surfaces or color
maps, while vector and tensor fields are represented by three-dimensional
arrows or displacement maps. Post-processing functions include arbitrary
section computation, offset, elevation, boundary extraction, color map and
range modification, animation, vector graphic output, etc. All
post-processing options can be accessed either interactively or through the
input ASCII text files. Scripting permits to automate all post-processing
operations, e.g.@: for the creation of animations. User-defined operations can
also be performed on post-processing views through dynamically loadable
plugins.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node What Gmsh is pretty good at, and what Gmsh is not so good at, Post-processing, Overview
@section What Gmsh is pretty good at @dots{}

Gmsh is a (relatively) small program, and was principally developed ``in
academia, to solve academic problems''@dots{} Nevertheless, over the
years, many people outside universities have found Gmsh useful in their
day-to-day jobs. Here is a tentative list of what Gmsh does best:

@itemize @bullet
@item
quickly describe simple and/or ``repetitive'' geometries, thanks to
user-defined functions, loops, conditionals and includes (see
@ref{User-defined functions}, @ref{Loops and conditionals}, and @ref{General
commands});
@item
parameterize these geometries. Gmsh's scripting language enables all
commands and command arguments to depend on previous calculations (see
@ref{Expressions}, and @ref{Geometry commands});
@item
generate 1D, 2D and 3D simplicial (i.e.@: using line segments, triangles and
tetrahedra) finite element meshes. The performance of the 1D and 2D
algorithms is pretty good; the 3D algorithm is still somewhat experimental
and slow (see @ref{Mesh module}, and @ref{Tutorial});
@item
specify target element sizes accurately. Gmsh provides several mechanisms to
control the size of the elements in the final mesh: through interpolation
from geometrical point characteristic lengths or geometrical attractors, or
from user-defined background meshes (@pxref{Mesh commands});
@item
create simple extruded geometries and meshes (see @ref{Geometry commands},
and @ref{Mesh commands});
@item
interact with external solvers. Gmsh provides C/C++ and Perl interfaces, and
others can be easily added (@pxref{Solver module});
@item
visualize computational results in a great variety of ways. Gmsh can display
scalar, vector and tensor data sets, and can perform various operations on
the resulting post-processing views (@pxref{Post-processing module});
@item
export plots in many different formats: vector PostScript or encapsulated
PostScript, LaTeX, PNG, JPEG,@w{ }@dots{} (@pxref{General options});
@item
generate complex animations (see @ref{General tools}, and @ref{t8.geo});
@item
run on low end machines and/or machines with no graphic system. Gmsh can be
compiled with or without the graphical user interface, and all versions can
be used either interactively or not, directly from the command line
(@pxref{Running Gmsh});
@item
configure your preferred options. Gmsh has a large number of configuration
options that can be set interactively using the GUI, scattered inside
command files, changed on the fly in scripts, set in per-user configuration
files, or specified on the command-line (see @ref{General options},
@ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Post-processing options},
and @ref{Running Gmsh});
@item
and do all the above on various platforms (Windows, Mac and Unix), for free
(@pxref{Copying conditions}), using clear-text ASCII files and/or a small
but powerful graphical user interface.
@end itemize

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c ... and what Gmsh is not so good at
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node and what Gmsh is not so good at, Syntactic rules, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Overview
@section @dots{} and what Gmsh is not so good at

Due to its historical background and limited developer manpower, Gmsh has
also some (a lot of?) weaknesses:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the bottom-up approach for describing geometries can become inconvenient for
complex models;
@item
there is no support for NURBS and only very limited support for trimmed
surfaces;
@item
Gmsh is not primarily a structured mesh generator: no automatic
quadrilateral or hexahedral meshing algorithm is provided. If you want
quadrangles, you have to use transfinite or extruded meshes or recombine
unstructured triangular meshes. For hexahedra, your only choice is
transfinite or extruded meshes;
@item
Gmsh is not a multi-bloc generator: all meshes produced by Gmsh are
conforming in the sense of finite element meshes;
@item
there is no support for curved mesh elements as of this writing (Gmsh
1.44);
@item
the user has no control over the quality of the mesh elements generated by
the 3D unstructured algorithm;
@item
Gmsh was designed to solve academic test-cases, not industrial-size
problems. You may find that Gmsh is too slow for large problems (with
thousands of geometric primitives, or millions of mesh/post-processing
elements).

@chapter General tools

This chapter describes the general commands and options that can be used in
Gmsh's ASCII text input files. By ``general'', we mean ``not specifically
related to one of the geometry, mesh, solver or post-processing
modules''. Commands peculiar to these modules will be introduced in
@ref{Geometry module}, @ref{Mesh module}, @ref{Solver module}, and
@ref{Post-processing module}, respectively.

Note that, if you are just beginning to use Gmsh, or just want to see what
Gmsh is all about, you really don't need to read this chapter and the four
next ones. Just have a quick look at @ref{Running Gmsh}, and go play with
the graphical user interface, running the tutorials and demonstration files
bundled in the distribution! Most of the commands and options described in
the following chapters are available interactively in the GUI, so you don't
need to worry about Gmsh's internals for creating your first geometries,
meshes and post-processing plots. Once you master the tutorial (read the
source files: they are heavily commented---see @ref{Tutorial}), you might
want to come back here to learn more about the specific syntax of Gmsh's
commands and esoteric options.

Floating point expressions (or, more simply, ``expressions'') are denoted by
the metasyntactic variable @var{expression} (remember the definition of the
syntactic rules in @ref{Syntactic rules}), and are evaluated during the
parsing of the data file:

@example
@var{expression}:
  @var{real} |
  @var{string} |
  @var{string} [ @var{expression} ] |
  ( @var{expression} ) |
  @var{operator-unary-left} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-unary-right} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-left} @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-right} @var{expression} |
  @var{built-in-function} |
  @var{real-option}
@end example

Such @w{@var{expression}s} are used in most of Gmsh's commands.  The
operators @var{operator-unary-left}, @var{operator-unary-right},
@var{operator-binary}, @var{operator-ternary-left} and
@var{operator-ternary-right} are defined in @ref{Operators}. For the
definition of @w{@var{built-in-function}s}, see @ref{Built-in
functions}. The various @w{@var{real-option}s} are listed in @ref{General
options}, @ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options}, @ref{Solver options},
and @ref{Post-processing options}.

@cindex Expressions, lists

List of expressions are also widely used, and are defined as:

@example
@var{expression-list}:
  @var{expression-list-item} <, @var{expression-list-item}> @dots{}
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-list-item}:
  @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{string} [ ] |
  @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ]
@end example

The second case in this last definition permits to create a list containing
the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s}, with a
unit incrementation step. The third case also permits to create a list
containing the range of numbers comprised between two @w{@var{expression}s},
but with a positive or negative incrementation step equal to the third
@var{expression}. The fourth case permits to reference an expression list.
The last case permits to reference an expression sublist (whose elements are
those corresponding to the indices provided by the
@var{expression-list}). To see the practical use of such expressions, have a
look at the first couple of examples in @ref{Tutorial}.

Note that, in order to lighten the syntax, you can always omit the braces
@code{@{@}} enclosing an @var{expression-list} if this @var{expression-list}
only contains a single item.

is an equivalent of the @code{sprintf} C function (where
@var{char-expression} is a format string that can contain floating point
formatting characters: @code{%e}, @code{%g}, etc.). The last case permits to
use the value of a @var{char-option} as a @var{char-expression}.  The

second case permits to define colors by using three expressions to specify
their red, green and blue components (with values comprised between 0 and

@ftable @code

@item @var{string} = @var{expression};
Defines a new expression identifier @var{string}, or affects
@var{expression} to an existing expression identifier. Eight expression
identifiers are predefined (hardcoded in Gmsh's parser):

@ftable @code
@item Pi
Returns 3.1415926535897932.

@item MPI_Size
Returns the number of processors on which Gmsh is running (always 1, except
if you compiled Gmsh's parallel extensions).

@item MPI_Rank
Returns the rank of the current processor.

@item newp
Returns the next available point number. As we will see in @ref{Geometry
module}, a unique number is associated with every geometrical point:
@code{newp} permits to know the highest number already attributed. This is
mostly useful when writing user-defined functions (@pxref{User-defined
functions}) or general geometric primitives, when one does not know @emph{a
priori} which numbers are already attributed, and which ones are still
available.

@item newl
Returns the next available line number.

@item news
Returns the next available surface number.

@item newv
Returns the next available volume number.

@item newreg
Returns the next available region number. That is, @code{newreg} returns the
maximum of @code{newp}, @code{newc}, @code{news}, @code{newv} and all
physical entity numbers@footnote{For compatibility purposes, the behavior
of @code{newc}, @code{news}, @code{newv} and @code{newreg} can be modified
with the @code{Geometry.OldNewReg} option (@pxref{Geometry options}).}.
@end ftable

@item @var{string} [ ] = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Defines a new expression list identifier @code{@var{string}[]}, or affects
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Affects each item in the right hand side @var{expression-list} to the
elements (indexed by the left hand side @var{expression-list}) of an
existing expression list identifier. The two @w{@var{expression-list}s} must
contain the same number of items. Remember the remark made when defining
@w{@var{expression-list}s}: the braces enclosing an @var{expression-list}
are optional if the list only contains a single item.

@item @var{real-option} = @var{expression};
Affects @var{expression} to a real option.

@item @var{char-option} = @var{char-expression};
Affects @var{char-expression} to a character option.

@item @var{color-option} = @var{color-expression};
Affects @var{color-expression} to a color option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} += @var{expression};
Adds and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier or to
a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} -= @var{expression};
Subtracts and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} *-= @var{expression};
Multiplies and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} | @var{real-option} /= @var{expression};
Divides and affects @var{expression} to an existing expression identifier
or to a real option.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Affects, item per item, the right hand side @var{expression-list} to an
existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] += @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Adds and affects, item per item, the right hand side @var{expression-list}
to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] -= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Subtracts and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] *= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Multiplies and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item @var{string} [ @{ @var{expression-list} @} ] /= @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Divides and affects, item per item, the right hand side
@var{expression-list} to an existing expression list identifier.

@item Exit;
Aborts the current script.

@item Printf ( @var{char-expression} , @var{expression-list} );
Prints a character expression in the information window and/or on the
terminal. @code{Printf} is equivalent to the @code{printf} C function:
@var{char-expression} is a format string that can contain formatting
characters (@code{%f}, @code{%e}, etc.). Note that all @w{@var{expression}s}
are evaluated as floating point values in Gmsh (@pxref{Expressions}), so
that only valid floating point formatting characters make sense in
@var{char-expression}. See @ref{t5.geo}, for an example of the use of
@code{Printf}.

@item Merge @var{char-expression};
Merges a file named @var{char-expression}. This command is equivalent to the
`File->Merge' menu in the graphical user interface.

@item MergeWithBoundingBox @var{char-expression};
Merges a file and forces the recalculation of the scene's bounding box.

@item Draw;
Redraws the scene.

@item Print @var{char-expression};
Prints the graphic window in a file named @var{char-expression}, using the
current @code{Print.Format} (@pxref{General options}).

@item Sleep @var{expression};
Suspends the execution of Gmsh during @var{expression} seconds.

@item System @var{char-expression};
Executes a system call.

@item Include @var{char-expression};
Includes the file named @var{char-expression} at the current position in the

the path in @var{char-expression} is not absolute, @var{char-expression} is
appended to the path of the including file.

Here is the list of the general @w{@var{char-option}s},

the default values to see the actual types). Most of these options are
accessible in the graphical user interface, but not all of them. When
running Gmsh interactively, changing an option in the ASCII text input file
will modify the option in the GUI in real time. This permits for example to
resize the graphical window in a script, or to interact with animations in
the script and in the GUI at the same time.

Gmsh's default behavior is to save some of these options in a per-user
``session resource'' file (@code{General.SessionFileName}) every time Gmsh
is shut down. This permits for example to automatically remember the size
and location of the windows or which fonts to use. Other options can be
saved in a per-user ``option'' file (@code{General.OptionsFileName}),
automatically loaded by Gmsh every time it starts up, by using the
`Tools->Options->Save' menu.

@chapter Geometry module

@cindex Geometry, module
@cindex Module, geometry

Gmsh's geometry module provides a simple CAD engine, using a bottom-up
approach: you need to first define points (using the @code{Point} command:
see below), then lines (using @code{Line}, @code{Circle}, @code{Spline},@w{
}@dots{}, commands or by extruding points), then surfaces (using for example
the @code{Plane Surface} or @code{Ruled Surface} commands, or by
extruding lines), and finally volumes (using the @code{Volume} command or by
extruding surfaces).

These geometrical entities are called ``elementary'' in Gmsh's jargon, and
are assigned identification numbers when they are created:

@enumerate
@item each elementary point must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary line must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary surface must possess a unique identification number;
@item each elementary volume must possess a unique identification number.
@end enumerate

@noindent Elementary geometrical entities can then be manipulated in various
ways, for example using the @code{Translate}, @code{Rotate}, @code{Scale} or
@code{Symmetry} commands.

Compound groups of elementary geometrical entities can also be defined and
are called ``physical'' entities. These physical entities cannot be modified
by geometry commands: their only purpose is to assemble elementary entities
into larger groups, possibly modifying their orientation, so that they can
be referred to by the mesh module as single entities. Each physical entity
is assigned a unique identification number when it is created. That is, no
two physical entities (even of different types, like a physical line and a
physical surface) can share identical identification numbers. See @ref{Mesh
module}, for more information about how physical entities affect the way
meshes are saved.

elementary lines that constitute the line loop. A line loop must be a closed
loop, and the elementary lines should be ordered and oriented (using
negative identification numbers to specify reverse orientation). If the
orientation is correct, but the ordering is wrong, Gmsh will actually
reorder the list internally to create a consistent loop. Although Gmsh
supports it, it is not recommended to specify multiple line loops (or
subloops) in a single @code{Line Loop} command. (Line loops are used to
create surfaces: see @ref{Surfaces}.)

belonging to the corresponding elementary lines in the saved mesh.

@section Elementary vs. physical entities

If only elementary geometrical entities are defined (or if the
@code{Mesh.SaveAll} option is set; see @ref{Mesh options}), the grid
produced by the mesh module will be saved ``as is''. That is, all the
elements in the grid will be saved to disk using the identification number
of the elementary entities they discretize as their region number
(@pxref{Gmsh mesh file format}). This can sometimes be inconvenient:

@itemize @bullet
@item
mesh elements cannot be duplicated;
@item 
the orientation of the mesh elements (the ordering of their nodes) is
determined entirely by the orientation of their ``parent'' elementary
entities, and cannot be modified;
@item
elements belonging to different elementary entities cannot be linked as
being part of a larger group having a physical or mathematical meaning (like
`Left wing', `Metallic part', `Dirichlet boundary condition', @dots{}).
@end itemize

To remedy these problems, the geometry module introduces the notion of
``physical'' entities (@pxref{Geometry module}). The purpose of physical
entities is to assemble elementary entities into larger, possibly
overlapping groups, and to control the orientation of the elements in these
groups. If physical entities are defined, the output mesh only contains
those elements that belong to physical entities. The introduction of such
physical entities in large models usually greatly facilitates the
manipulation of the model (e.g.@: using `Tools->Visibility' in the GUI) and
the interfacing with external solvers.

and specify structured grid parameters. The actual mesh ``actions'' (i.e.,
``mesh the lines'', ``mesh the surfaces'' and ``mesh the volumes'') cannot

@cindex Characteristic lengths
@cindex Mesh, element size
@cindex Size, elements
@cindex Mesh, background
@cindex Background mesh

The `size' of a mesh element is defined as the length of the segment for a
line segment, the radius of the circumscribed circle for a triangle and the
radius of the circumscribed sphere for a tetrahedron. There are three main
ways to specify the size of the mesh elements for a given geometry:

@enumerate
@item
You can specify characteristic lengths at the points of the geometrical
model (with the @code{Point} command: see @ref{Points}). The actual size of
the mesh elements will be computed by linearly interpolating these
characteristic lengths on the initial mesh (see @ref{Mesh}). This might
sometimes lead to over-refinement in some areas, so that you may have to add
``dummy'' geometrical entities in the model in order to get the desired
element sizes.

This method works with all the algorithms implemented in the mesh
module. The final element sizes are of course constrained by the structured
algorithms for which the element sizes are explicitly specified (e.g.@:
transfinite and extruded grids: see @ref{Structured grids}).
@item
You can use geometrical ``attractors'', an elaborate version of the method
described in the preceding item: see the definition of the @code{Attractor}
command below.

Attractors currently only work with the 2D anisotropic algorithm (see the
@code{Mesh.Algorithm} option in @ref{Mesh options}).
@item
You can give Gmsh an explicit background mesh in the form of a scalar
post-processing view (see @ref{Post-processing commands}, and @ref{File
formats}) in which the nodal values are the target element sizes.  This
method is very general but it requires a first (usually rough) mesh and a
way to compute the target sizes on this mesh (usually through an error
estimation procedure, in an iterative process of mesh adaptation). Note that
the target element sizes can be constrained by the characteristic lengths
defined in the geometrical model if the
@code{Mesh.ConstrainedBackgroundMesh} option is set.

This method only works with the isotropic 1D, 2D and 3D algorithm, and is
not currently available with the Triangle algorithm. To load a background
mesh, use the @code{-bgm} command-line option (@pxref{Command-line options})
or select `Apply as background mesh' in the post-processing view option
menu.
@end enumerate

Here are the mesh commands that are related to the specification of
characteristic lengths:

@ftable @code
@item Attractor Point | Line @{ @var{expression-list} @} = @{ @var{expression}, @var{expression}, @var{expression} @};
Specifies a characteristic length attractor. The @var{expression-list}
should contain the identification numbers of the elementary points or lines
to serve as attractors; the two first @w{@var{expression}s} prescribe
refinement factors in a coordinate system local to the entities, and the
last @var{expression} a decay factor. This feature is still experimental,
and only works with the 2D anisotropic algorithm (see @code{Mesh.Algorithm}
in @ref{Mesh options}).  An example of the use of attractors is given in
@ref{t7.geo}.

@item Characteristic Length @{ @var{expression-list} @} = @var{expression};
Modifies the characteristic length of the points whose identification
numbers are listed in @var{expression-list}. The new value is given by
@var{expression}.

extruded and has the following syntax:

number to each layer. The last @var{expression-list} gives the normalized
height of each layer (the list should contain a sequence of @var{n} numbers
0 < @var{h1} < @var{h2} < @dots{} < @var{hn} <= 1). See @ref{t3.geo}, for an
example.

For line extrusions, the @code{Recombine} option will recombine triangles
into quadrangles when possible.  For surface extrusions, the
@code{Recombine} option will recombine tetrahedra into prisms, hexahedra or

@item Transfinite Line @{ @var{expression-list} @} = @var{expression} < Using Progression | Bump @var{expression} >
Selects the lines in @var{expression-list} to be meshed with the 1D
transfinite algorithm. The @var{expression} on the right hand side gives the
number of nodes that will be created on the line (this overrides any
characteristic length prescription---see @ref{Characteristic lengths}). The
optional argument `@code{Using Progression @var{expression}}' instructs the
transfinite algorithm to distribute the nodes following a geometric
progression (@code{Progression 2} meaning for example that each line element
in the series will be twice as long as the preceding one). The optional
argument `@code{Using Bump @var{expression}}' instructs the transfinite
algorithm to distribute the nodes with a refinement at both ends of the
line.  (A deprecated synonym for @code{Progression} is @code{Power}.)

@item Transfinite Surface @{ @var{expression} @} = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Selects the surface @var{expression} to be meshed with the 2D transfinite
algorithm (the surface can only have three or four sides). The
@var{expression-list} should contain the identification numbers of the
points on the boundary of the surface. The ordering of these point numbers
defines the ordering and orientation of the mesh elements, and should thus
follow the node ordering for triangles or quadrangles given in @ref{Gmsh
node ordering}.

@item Transfinite Volume @{ @var{expression} @} = @{ @var{expression-list} @};
Selects the volume @var{expression} to be meshed with the 3D transfinite
algorithm (the volume can only have six or eight faces).  The

Five external solvers can be interfaced simultaneously with Gmsh.

If you just want to start a solver from the solver module, with no further
interactions between the solver and Gmsh, just edit the options relative to
one of the five available solvers (e.g.@: @code{Solver.Name0},
@code{Solver.Executable0}, @dots{}; see @ref{Solver options}), and set the
corresponding ``client-server'' option to zero
(e.g.@: @code{Solver.ClientServer0 = 0}). This doesn't require any
modification to be made to the solver.

If you want the solver to interact with Gmsh (for error messages, option
definitions, post-processing, etc.), you need to link your solver with the
@file{GmshClient.c} file and add the appropriate function calls inside your
program. You can then proceed as in the previous case, but this time you
should set the client-server option to 1 (e.g.@: @code{Solver.ClientServer0
= 1}), so that Gmsh and the solver can communicate through a Unix
socket. See @ref{Solver example}, for an example of how to interface a C
solver. Bindings for solvers written in other languages (e.g.@: Perl) are
available on @value{GMSH-WEB}.

Gmsh's post-processing module can handle multiple scalar, vector or tensor
data sets along with the geometry and the mesh. The data sets should be
given in one of Gmsh's post-processing file formats described in @ref{File
formats}. Once loaded into Gmsh, scalar fields can be displayed as iso-value
lines and surfaces or color maps, whereas vector and tensor fields can be
represented either by three-dimensional arrows or by displacement maps. In
Gmsh's jargon, each data set is called a ``view'', and can arbitrarily mix
all types of elements and fields. Each view is given a name, and can be
manipulated either individually (each view has its own button in the GUI and
can be referred to by its index in the scripting language) or globally (see
the @code{PostProcessing.LinkView} option in @ref{Post-processing
options}).

Although visualization is usually mostly an interactive task, Gmsh exposes
all the post-processing commands and options to the user in its scripting
language to permit a complete automation of the post-processing process (see
e.g.@: @ref{t8.geo}, and @ref{t9.geo}).

The two following sections summarize all available post-processing commands
and options.

(the view is read through Gmsh's script parser, which can become quite slow
if the view is large---e.g.@: with more than 100,000 elements).  Though,
this ``parsed'' post-processing format (explained in detail in @ref{Gmsh

since all the values are @var{expressions}. Two other formats, better
adapted for large data sets, are described in @ref{Gmsh ASCII

General post-processing option names have the form
`@code{PostProcessing.@var{string}}'. Options peculiar to post-processing
views take two forms:

@enumerate
@item options that should apply to all views can be set through
`@code{View.@var{string}}', @emph{before any view is loaded};
@item options that should apply only to the @var{n}-th
view take the form `@code{View[@var{n}].@var{string}}' (@var{n} = 0, 1, 2,
@dots{}), @emph{after the @var{n}-th view is loaded}.
@end enumerate

See @ref{t8.geo}, and @ref{t9.geo}, for some examples.

@section Interactive vs. non-interactive mode

@cindex Interactive mode
@cindex Non-interactive mode

There are several ways to actually run Gmsh on your computer@footnote{Note
that these operation modes can slightly vary depending on your operating
system and/or command shell.}. The first working mode of Gmsh is the
interactive graphical mode. To launch Gmsh in interactive mode, just click
or double-click on the Gmsh icon (Windows and Mac), or type

@example
> gmsh
@end example

@noindent at your shell prompt on the command line (Unix). This will open
two windows: the graphic window (with a status bar at the bottom) and the
menu window (with a menu bar and some context dependent buttons). To open
the first tutorial file (@pxref{Tutorial}), select the `File->Open' menu,
and choose @file{t1.geo} in the input field. To perform the mesh generation,
go to the mesh module (by selecting `Mesh' in the module menu) and choose
the required dimension in the context-dependent buttons (`1D' will mesh all
the lines; `2D' will mesh all the surfaces---as well as all the lines if
`1D' was not called before; `3D' will mesh all the volumes---and all the
surfaces if `2D' was not called before). To save the resulting mesh in the
current mesh format, choose `Save' in the context-dependent buttons, or
select the appropriate format with the `File->Save as' menu. The default
mesh file name is based on the name of the first input file on the command
line (or @file{untitled} if there wasn't any input file given), with an
appended extension depending on the mesh format.

Note that nearly all the interactive commands have shortcuts: see
@ref{Keyboard shortcuts}, or select `Help->Shortcuts' in the menu bar to
learn about these.

Instead of opening the tutorial with the `File->Open' menu, it is
often more convenient to put the file name on the command line, for
example with:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo
@end example

Note that, even if it is often handy to define the variables and the points
directly in the ASCII input files (you can use any text editor for this
purpose, e.g.@: Wordpad on Windows, or Emacs on Unix), it is almost always
simpler to define the lines, the surfaces and the volumes interactively. To
do so, just follow the context dependent buttons in the Geometry module. For
example, to create a spline, select `Geometry' in the module menu, and then
select `Elementary, Add, New, Spline'. You will then be asked (in the status
bar of the graphic window) to select a list of points, and to type @kbd{e}
to finish the selection (or @kbd{q} to abort it). Once the interactive
command is completed, a string is automatically added at the end of the
currently opened project file.

Gmsh's second operating mode is the non-interactive mode. In this mode,
there is no graphical user interface, and all operations are performed
without any user interaction@footnote{If you compile Gmsh without the
graphical user interface, i.e.@: with @code{./configure --disable-gui}, this
is the only mode you have access to.}. To mesh the first tutorial in
non-interactive mode, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2
@end example

To mesh the same example, but with the background mesh available in the file
@file{bgmesh.pos}, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2 -bgm bgmesh.pos
@end example

You should read the notes in the file @file{bgmesh.pos} if you intend to use
background meshes.

Several files can be loaded simultaneously in Gmsh. The first one defines
the project, while the others are appended (`merged') to this project. You
can merge such files with the `File->Merge' menu, or by directly specifying
the names of the files on the command line. This is most useful for
post-processing purposes. For example, to merge the post-processing views
contained in the files @file{view1.pos} and @file{view2.pos} together with
the first tutorial @file{t1.geo}, you can type the following command:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo view1.pos view2.pos
@end example

In the Post-Processing module (select `Post-Processing' in the module
menu), two view buttons will appear, respectively labeled `a scalar
map' and `a vector map'. A mouse click on the name will toggle the
visibility of the selected view, while a click on the arrow button on
the right will provide access to the view's options. If you want the
modifications made to one view to affect also all the other views,
select the `Apply next changes to all views' or `Force same options
for all views' option in the `Tools->Options->Post-processing' menu.

Note that all the options specified interactively can also be directly
specified in the ASCII input files. All available options, with their
current values, can be saved into a file by selecting `File->Save as->Gmsh
options', or simply viewed by pressing the `?' button in the status bar. To
save the current options as your default preferences for all future Gmsh
sessions, use the `Tools->Options->Save' button.

This chapter describes the file formats that cannot be modified by the
user. These formats have a version number (currently 1.2), independent of the
Gmsh version number (currently @value{GMSH-VERSION}).

All non-parsed file formats have sections enclosed between @code{$KEY} and
@code{$ENDKEY} tags.

The @file{.msh} file format is Gmsh's native mesh file format. The file is
divided in two sections, defining the nodes (@code{$NOD}-@code{$ENDNOD}) and
the elements (@code{$ELM}-@code{$ENDELM}) in the mesh:

@example
$NOD
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}

$ENDNOD
$ELM
@var{number-of-elements}
@var{elm-number} @var{elm-type} @var{reg-phys} @var{reg-elem} @var{number-of-nodes} @var{node-number-list}
@dots{}
$ENDELM
@end example

@noindent
where
@table @code
@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes in the mesh

@item @var{node-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th node in the mesh. Note that the
@w{@var{node-number}s} do not have to be given in a consecutive (or even an
ordered) way.

@item @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
are the floating point values giving the X, Y and Z coordinates of the
@var{n}-th node.

@item @var{number-of-elements}
is the number of elements in the mesh

@item @var{elm-number}
is the number (index) of the @var{n}-th element in the mesh. Note that the
@w{@var{elm-number}s} do not have to be given in a consecutive (or even an
ordered) way.

@item @var{elm-type}
defines the geometrical type of the @var{n}-th element:
@table @code
@item 1
Line (2 nodes, 1 edge).
@item 2
Triangle (3 nodes, 3 edges).
@item 3
Quadrangle (4 nodes, 4 edges).
@item 4

@item 6
Prism (6 nodes, 9 edges, 5 facets).
@item 7
Pyramid (5 nodes, 8 edges, 5 facets).
@item 15
Point (1 node).
@end table

@item @var{reg-phys}
is the number of the physical entity to which the element belongs. 

@item @var{reg-elem}
is the number of the elementary entity to which the element belongs.

@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes for the @var{n}-th element. This is redundant, but
kept for backward compatibility. The redundancy may disappear in the future
if higher order elements are implemented using the same @w{@var{elm-type}s}
as the current ones.

@item @var{node-number-list}
is the list of the @var{number-of-nodes} node numbers of the @var{n}-th
element (separated by white space, without commas).

@item

fwrite(time-step-values, sizeof(double), nb-time-steps, file);
fwrite(all-scalar-point-values, sizeof(double), ..., file);
...
fprintf(file, "\n$EndView\n");
@end example
In this pseudo-code, @var{all-scalar-point-values} is the array of double
precision numbers containing all the @var{scalar-point-value} lists, put one
after each other in order to form a long array of doubles. The principle is
the same for all other kinds of values.

For relatively small data sets Gmsh provides an additional post-processing
format, which is read by Gmsh's script parser. You can thus, for example,
embed small post-processing views directly into your geometrical
descriptions (see e.g.@: @ref{t4.geo}). This format is also useful for
testing purposes: its syntax is very permissive, and you can easily generate
it by hand or on the fly. The format of the parsed post-processing file is
the following:

@example
@group
View "@var{string}" @{
  @var{type} ( @var{list-of-coords} ) @{ @var{list-of-values} @};
  @dots{}
@};
@end group
@end example

The 26 objects that can be displayed are the same as in the ASCII or binary
post-processing file formats:

For historical reasons, contrary to the ASCII and binary post-processing
file formats, the coordinates are given `by node', i.e.:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{(coord1, coord2,coord3)} for a point,
@item 
@code{(coord1-node1, coord2-node1, coord3-node1,}@* 
@code{ coord1-node2, coord2-node2, coord3-node2)} for a line,
@item 
@code{(coord1-node1, coord2-node1, coord3-node1,}@*
@code{ coord1-node2, coord2-node2, coord3-node2,}@*
@code{ coord1-node3, coord2-node3, coord3-node3)} for a triangle,
@item
etc.
@end itemize

@noindent The values are given in the same order as for the ASCII and binary
post-processing file formats.

@cindex Programming, notes

Gmsh was originally written in C, and later enhanced with various C++
additions. The resulting code is a hybrid C/C++ beast, hopefully not too
badly structured... The scripting language is parsed using Lex and Yacc
(actually, Flex and Bison), while the GUI relies on OpenGL for the 3D
graphics and FLTK for the widget set. See @uref{http://www.opengl.org},
@uref{http://www.mesa3d.org} and @uref{http://www.fltk.org} for more
information.

Gmsh's build system is based on autoconf, and should work on most modern
platforms providing standard compliant C and C++ compilers. Practical notes
on how to compile Gmsh's source code are included in the distribution. Note
that compiling the Windows version requires the Cygwin tools (freely
available from @uref{http://www.cygwin.com}). See the @file{FAQ} for more
information.

If you plan to contribute code to the Gmsh project, here are some easy rules
to make the code easy to read/debug/maintain:

@enumerate
@item
please enable full warnings for your compiler (e.g.@: add @code{-Wall} to
@code{FLAGS} in the @file{variables} file);
@item
always use the @code{Msg()} function to print information, errors, @dots{};
@item 
indent your files using @file{utils/misc/indent.sh};
@item
if working on Windows, don't leave tabs in your files (e.g.@: untabify them
with @file{utils/misc/untabify.sh}).
@end enumerate

If you think you have found a bug in Gmsh, you can report it by electronic
mail to the Gmsh mailing list at @email{gmsh@@geuz.org}.  Please send as
precise a description of the problem as you can, including sample input
files that produce the bug. Don't forget to mention both the version of Gmsh
and the version of your operation system (@pxref{Command-line options} to
see how to get this information).

See the @file{TODO} file in the distribution to check the problems we
already know about.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Install the `info' version of this user's guide! On your (Unix) system, this
can be achieved by

@enumerate
@item
copying all @file{gmsh.info*} files to the place where your info files live
(usually @file{/usr/info}), and
@item
issuing the command @code{install-info /usr/info/gmsh.info /usr/info/dir}.
@end enumerate

You will then be able to access the documentation with the command
@code{info gmsh}. Note that particular sections (`nodes') can be accessed
directly. For example, @code{info gmsh surfaces} or @code{info gmsh surf}
will take you directly to @ref{Surfaces}.
@item
Use emacs to edit your files, and load the C++ mode! This permits automatic
syntax highlighting and easy indentation. Automatic loading of the C++ mode
for @file{.geo} files can be achieved by adding the following command in
your @code{.emacs} file: @code{(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.geo$"
. c++-mode)) auto-mode-alist))}.
@item
Define common geometrical objects and options in separate files, reusable in
all your problem definition structures.
@item
Save your preferred options with `Tools->Options->Save'. To reset default
options, erase the @code{General.OptionsFileName} (usually
@file{.gmsh-options} in your home directory) or use the `Restore default
options' button in `Tools->Options->General->Output'.
@item
In the graphical user interface:

@itemize --
@item
dragging the mouse in a numeric input field slides the value. The left
button moves one step per pixel, the middle by 10 * step, and the right
button by 100 * step;
@item
selecting the content of an input field, or lines in the message console
(Tools->Message console), copies the selected text to the clipboard;
