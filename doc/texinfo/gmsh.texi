@cindex Introduction
@cindex Overview

Gmsh is an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh generator,
primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Its
primal design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test
cases with parametric input and up to date visualization capabilities.  One
of the strengths of Gmsh is its ability to respect a characteristic length
field for the generation of adapted meshes on lines, surfaces and
volumes. These adapted meshes can be mixed with simple structured
(transfinite, extruded, etc.) meshes in order to augment the flexibility.
All geometrical, mesh, solver and post-processing instructions are
prescribed either interactively using the graphical user interface or in
ASCII data files using Gmsh's own scripting language.

Gmsh is structured around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and
post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done
either interactively, or in text data files (interactive specifications
generate language bits in the input file, and vice versa). The accessibility
of most features in the ASCII text file makes it possible to automate all
treatments (loops, tests and external access methods permit advanced
scripting capabilities). The internal kernel of Gmsh reflects this
structure: it is built around a geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing
module. A brief description of these four modules is given hereafter.

@c Geometry: geometrical entity definition
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Geometry, Mesh, Overview, Overview
@section Geometry: geometrical entity definition

Geometries are created in a bottom-up flow by successively defining
points, oriented curves (segments, circles, ellipses, splines, etc.),
oriented surfaces (plane surfaces, ruled surfaces, etc.) and
volumes. Compound groups of geometrical entities can be defined, based
on these elementary parametrized geometric entities. Data can be
defined either interactively thanks to the menu system, or directly in
the ASCII input files.  The scripting possibilities (with loops,
tests, arrays of variables, etc.) allow fully parametrized definitions
of all geometrical entities.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Mesh: finite element mesh generation
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Mesh, Solver, Geometry, Overview
@section Mesh: finite element mesh generation

A finite element mesh is a tessellation of a given subset of R3 by
elementary geometrical elements of various shapes (in this case lines,
triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra, prisms, hexahedra and pyramids),
arranged in such a way that if two of them intersect, they do so along a
face, an edge or a node, and never otherwise. All the finite element meshes
produced by Gmsh as unstructured, even if they were generated in a
structured way. This implies that the elementary geometrical elements are
defined only by an ordered list of their vertices (which allows the
orientation of all their lower order geometrical entities) but no predefined
relation is assumed between any two elementary elements.

The mesh generation is performed in the same order as the geometry
creation: curves are discretized first; the mesh of the curves is then
used to mesh the surfaces; then the mesh of the surfaces is used to
mesh the volumes. This automatically assures the continuity of the
mesh when, for example, two surfaces share a common curve. Every
meshing step is constrained by the characteristic length field, which
can be uniform, specified by characteristic length associated to
elementary geometrical entities, or associated to another mesh (the
background mesh).

For each meshing step (i.e. the discretization of lines, surfaces and
volumes), all structured mesh directives are executed first, and serve
as additional constraints for the unstructured parts. The implemented
Delaunay algorithm is subdivided in the following five steps for
surface/volume discretization:

@enumerate
@item
trivial meshing of a box including the convex polygon/polyhedron defined by
the boundary nodes resulting from the discretization of the curves/surfaces;
@item
creation of the initial mesh by insertion of all the nodes on the
curves/surfaces thanks to the Bowyer algorithm;
@item
boundary restoration to force all the edges/faces of the curves/surfaces to
be present in the initial mesh;
@item
suppression of all the unwanted triangles/tetrahedra (in particular those
containing the nodes of the initial box);
@item
insertion of new nodes by the Bowyer algorithm until the characteristic size
of each simplex is lower or equal to the characteristic length field
evaluated at the center of its circumscribed circle/sphere.

@c Solver: external solver interface
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Solver, Post-processing, Mesh, Overview
@section Solver: external solver interface

External solvers can be interfaced with Gmsh through Unix sockets, which
permits to easily launch computations either locally or on remote computers,
and to collect and exploit the simulation results within Gmsh. The default
solver interfaced with Gmsh is GetDP
(@uref{http://www.geuz.org/getdp/}). @xref{Solver}, to see how to define
your own solver.

@c Post-processing: scalar and vector field visualization
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Post-processing, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Solver, Overview
@section Post-processing: scalar and vector field visualization

Multiple post-processing scalar or vector maps can be loaded and manipulated
(globally or individually) along with the geometry and the mesh. Scalar
fields are represented by iso-value curves/surfaces or color maps and vector
fields by three-dimensional arrows or displacement maps. Post-processing
functions include arbitrary section computation, offset, elevation, boundary
extraction, color map and range modification, animation, vector graphic
output, etc. All post-processing options can be accessed either
interactively or through the input ASCII text files. Scripting permits to
automate all the post-processing operations (e.g. for the creation of
complex animations). User-defined operations can also be performed on
post-proessing views through to dynamically loadable modules (plug-ins).

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node What Gmsh is pretty good at, and what it is not so good at, Post-processing, Overview
@section What Gmsh is pretty good at @dots{}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Describe quickly simple and/or ``repetitive'' geometries. Models are
constructed by defining successively points, curves, surfaces and volumes
(@pxref{Geometry}). Loops and includes can be used to perform repetitive
tasks (@pxref{Loops and tests}, @pxref{General commands}).
@item
Parameterize these geometries: the model is described in Gmsh's own
language, where all commands and command arguments can depend on previous
calculations.
@item
Generate 1D, 2D and 3D simplicial (i.e. using line segments, triangles and
tetrahedra) finite element meshes. The 1D and 2D algorithms should have
pretty good performance in most cases. The 3D algorithm is still more
experimental.
@item
Specify target element sizes: Gmsh provides several mechanisms to control
the size of the elements in the final (interpolation from geometrical point
characteristic lengths, explicit background mesh, attractors).
@item
Create simple extruded geometries and meshes.
@item
Interact with your solver: Gmsh provides C/C++ and perl interfaces, and
others can be easily added (@pxref{Solver}).
@item
Visualize computational results in a great variety of ways. Gmsh can
display scalar, vector and tensor data sets in many different ways.
@item
Perform various operations on the post-processing views using plugins
(@pxref{Post-processing}).
@item
Exports plots in many different formats (vector PostScript or encapsulated
PostScript, LaTeX, PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.).
@item
Generate complex animations.
@item
Run on low end machines and/or machines without graphic systems: Gmsh can be
compiled with or without the graphical user interface; graphical versions
can be used either interactively or without graphicak output, directly from
the command-line.
@item
Configure your preferred options for all subsequent operations: Gmsh has a
large number of configurations options that can be set interactively,
scattered inside command files (and changed on the fly in scripts), set in
per-user configuration files, or specified on the command-line
(@pxref{General options}, @ref{Geometry options}, @ref{Mesh options},
@ref{Post-processing options} and @ref{Running Gmsh}).

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node and what it is not so good at, Syntactic rules, What Gmsh is pretty good at, Overview
@section @dots{} and what it is not so good at

@itemize @bullet
@item
The bottom-up approach for describing geometries can become tedious for
complex structures.
@item
There is no support for NURBS and only very limited support for trimmed
surfaces.
@item
Gmsh is not primarily a structured mesh generator: no automatic
quadrilateral or hexahedral meshing algorithm is provided. If you want
quadrangles, you have to use transfinite or extruded meshes (@pxref{Mesh})
or recombine unstructured triangular meshes. For hexahedra, your only choice
is transfinite or extruded meshes.
@item
Gmsh is not a multibloc generator: all meshes produced by Gmsh are
conforming in the sense of finite element meshes (@pxref{Mesh})
@item
There is not support for curved mesh elements as of this writing (Gmsh
1.44).
@item
Gmsh is designed for solving academic test-cases, not industrial-size
problems. You may find that Gmsh is too slow for large problems (with
thousands of geometric primitives; or millions of mesh/post-processing
elements).

@item 
Metasyntactic variables (i.e.@: text bits that are not part of the syntax,
but stand for other text bits) are printed like @var{this}.
@item 
A colon (@code{:}) after a metasyntactic variable separates the variable
from its definition.
@item

The two constant types used in Gmsh are @var{real} and @var{string} (there
is no integer type).  These types have the same meaning and syntax as in the
C or C++ programming languages.  Expressions are denoted by the
metasyntactic variable @var{expression} (remember the definition of the
syntactic rules in @ref{Syntactic rules}), and are evaluated during the
parsing of the data file:

@example
@var{expression}:
  @var{real} |
  @var{expression-id} |
  @var{operator-unary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-ternary-left} @var{expression}
      @var{operator-ternary-right} @var{expression} |
  @var{built-in-function}
@end example

The operators @var{operator-unary}, @var{operator-binary} and
@var{operator-ternary-left}/@var{operator-ternary-right} are defined in
@ref{Operators}. The @var{built-in-function}s are defined in @ref{Built-in
functions}.

List of expressions are defined as:

@example
@var{expression-list}:
  @var{expression-list-item} <, @var{expression-list-item}> @dots{}
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-list-item}:
  @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} : @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{expression-id} @{@} |
  @var{expression-id} @{ @var{expression-list} @}
@end example

The second case in this last definition permits to create a list containing
the range of numbers comprised between two @var{expression}s, with a unit
incrementation step. The third case also permits to create a list containing
the range of numbers comprised between two @var{expression}s, but with a
positive or negative incrementation step equal to the third
@var{expression}. The fourth and fifth cases permit to lists or sublists of
expressions. The syntax for the definition of expression identifiers is:

@example
@var{expression-id} = @var{expression-def};
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{expression-id}:
  @var{string} |
  Pi |
  MPI_Rank | MPI_Size |
  newp | newl | news | newv | newreg

@var{expression-def}:
  @var{expression-list-item} |
  @{ @var{expression-list} @}
@end example

The only expressions predefined in Gmsh are @code{Pi} (=
3.1415926535897932), @code{MPI_Size} (which returns the number of processors
on which Gmsh is running), @code{MPI_Rank} (which returns the rank of the
current processor), @code{newp} (returns the next available point number),
@code{newc} (returns the next available curve number), @code{news} (returns
the next available surface number), @code{newv} (returns the next available
volume number) and @code{newreg} (returns the next available region number).

Character expressions can also be defined (but there exists no character
expression identifier at the moment):

@example
@var{expression-char}:
  "@var{string}" |
  StrPrefix[ @var{expression-char} ] |
  StrCat[ @var{expression-char} , @var{expression-char} ] |
  Sprintf[ @var{expression-char} , @var{expression-list} ]
@end example

@noindent The third casein this definition permits to take the
prefix of a string (e.g. for removing the extension from a file name). The
fourth case permits to concatenate two character expressions. The fifth is
an equivalent of the @code{sprintf} C function (@var{expression-char} is a
format string that can contain floating point formatting characters:
@code{%e}, @code{%g}, etc.).

@section Interactive vs. non-interactive mode

There are several different ways to actually run Gmsh on your
computer@footnote{Note that these operation modes can slightly vary
depending on the operating system and/or shell you use.} The first working
mode of Gmsh is the interactive graphical mode. To launch Gmsh in
interactive mode, just click or double-click on the Gmsh icon (Windows and
Mac), or type

@example
> gmsh
@end example

@noindent at your shell prompt on the command line (Unix). This will open
two windows: the graphic window (with a status bar at the bottom) and the
menu window (with a menu bar and some context dependent buttons). To open
the first tutorial file, select the 'File->Open' menu, and choose
@file{t1.geo} in the input field. To perform the mesh generation, go to the
mesh module (by selecting 'Mesh' in the module menu) and choose the required
dimension in the context-dependent buttons ('1D' will mesh all the curves;
'2D' will mesh all the surfaces---as well as all the curves if '1D' was not
called before; '3D' will mesh all the volumes---and all the surfaces if '2D'
was not called before). To save the resulting mesh in the current mesh
format, choose 'Save' in the context-dependent buttons, or select the
appropriate format with the 'File->Save as' menu. The default mesh file name
is based on the name of the first input file on the command line (or
'untitled' if there wasn't any input file given), with an appended extension
depending on the mesh format.

Note that nearly all the interactive commands have shortcuts: see
@ref{Keyboard shortcuts} or select 'Help->Shortcuts' in the menu bar to
learn about these.

Instead of opening the tutorial with the 'File->Open' menu, it is
often more convenient to put the file name on the command line, for
example with:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo
@end example

Note that, even if it is often handy to define the variables and the points
directly in the input files (you may use any text editor for this purpose,
e.g. Wordpad on Windows, or Emacs on Unix), it is almost always more simple
to define the curves, the surfaces and the volumes interactively. To do so,
just follow the context dependent buttons in the Geometry module. For
example, to create a spline, select 'Geometry' in the module menu, and then
select 'Elementary, Add, New, Spline'. You will then be asked (in the status
bar of the graphic window) to select a list of points, and to click 'e' to
finish the selection (or 'q' to abort it). Once the interactive command is
completed, a string is automatically added at the end of the currently
opened project file.

The second operating mode for Gmsh is the non-interactive mode. In this
mode, there is no graphical user interface, and all operations are performed
without any user interaction@footnote{If you compile Gmsh without the
graphical user interface, i.e. with @code{./configure --disable-gui}, this
is the only mode you;ll have access to.}. To mesh the first tutorial in
non-interactive mode, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2
@end example

To mesh the same example, but with the background mesh available in the file
@file{bgmesh.pos}, just type:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo -2 -bgm bgmesh.pos
@end example

You should read the notes in the file @file{bgmesh.pos} if you intend to use
background meshes.

Several files can be loaded simultaneously in Gmsh. The first one defines
the project, while the others are appended ("merged") to this project. You
can merge such files with the 'File->Merge' menu, or by directly specifying
the names of the files on the command line. This is most useful for
post-processing purposes. For example, to merge the post-processing views
contained in the files @file{view1.pos} and @file{view2.pos} together with
the first tutorial @file{t1.geo}, you can type the following command:

@example
> gmsh t1.geo view1.pos view2.pos
@end example

In the Post-Processing module (select 'Post_Processing' in the module
menu), two view buttons will appear, respectively labeled "a scalar
map" and "a vector map". A mouse click on the name will toggle the
visibility of the selected view, while a click on the arrow button on
the right will provide access to the view's options. If you want the
modifications made to one view to affect also all the other views,
select the 'Apply next changes to all views' or 'Force same options
for all views' option in the 'Tools->Options->Post-processing' menu.

Note that all the options specified interactively can also be directly
specified in the ASCII input files. All available options, with their
current values, can be saved into a file by selecting 'File->Save as->Gmsh
options', or simply viewed by pressing the '?' button in the status bar. To
save the current options as your default preferences for all future Gmsh
sessions, use the 'Tools->Options->Save' button.

@cindex @file{.msh} file

The @file{.msh} file format is Gmsh's native mesh file format. The file is
divided into two sections, defining the nodes (@code{NOD}-@code{ENDNOD}) and
the elements (@code{ELM}-@code{ENDELM}) in the mesh:

@example
$NOD
@var{number-of-nodes}
@var{node-number} @var{x-coord} @var{y-coord} @var{z-coord}
@dots{}
$ENDNOD
$ELM
@var{number-of-elements}
@var{elm-number} @var{elm-type} @var{reg-phys} @var{reg-elemem} @var{number-of-nodes} @var{node-number-list}
@dots{}
$ENDELM
@end example

@noindent
where
@table @code
@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes in the mesh

@item @var{node-number}
is the number (index) of the n-th node in the mesh. Note that the
@var{node-number}s should not necessarily given in a consecutive (or even an
ordered) way.

@item @var{x-coord}
@item @var{y-coord}
@item @var{z-coord}
are the floating point values giving the X, Y and Z coordinate of the n-th
node.

@item @var{number-of-elements}
is the number of elements in the mesh

@item @var{elm-number}
is the number (index) of the n-th element in the mesh. Note that the
@var{elm-number}s should not necessarily given in a consecutive (or even an
ordered) way.

@item @var{elm-type}
defines the geometrical type for the n-th element:
@table @code
@item 1
Line (2 nodes, 1 edge).
@item 2
Triangle (3 nodes, 3 edges).
@item 3
Quadrangle (4 nodes, 4 edges).
@item 4

@item 5
Hexahedron (8 nodes, 12 edges, 6 facets).
@item 6
Prism (6 nodes, 9 edges, 5 facets).
@item 7
Pyramid (5 nodes, 8 edges, 5 facets).
@item 15
Point (1 node).
@end table

@item @var{reg-phys}
is the number of the physical entity to which the element belongs. 

@item @var{reg-elem}
is the number of the elementary entity to which the element belongs.

@item @var{number-of-nodes}
is the number of nodes for the n-th element. This is redundant, but kept for
backward compatibility reasons. The redundancy may disappear in the future
if higher order elements are implemented using the same @var{elm-type}s as
the current ones.

@item @var{node-number-list}
is a list of @var{number-of-nodes} node numbers (separated by white space,
without commas).

where
@table @code
@item @var{file-type}
is an integer equal to 0 in the ASCII file format.

@item @var{data-size}
is an integer equal to the size of the floating point numbers used in the
file (usually, data-size == sizeof(double)).

@item @var{view-name}
is a string containing the name of the view (max. 256 characters)

@item @var{nb-time-step}
is an integer giving the number of time steps in the view

@item @var{nb-scalar-points}
@item @var{nb-vector-points}
@item @dots{}
are integers giving the number of scalar points, vector points, @dots{} in
the view.

@item @var{nb-text2d}
@item @var{nb-text3d}
are integers giving the number of 2D and 3D text strings in the
view. 

@item @var{nb-text2d-chars}
@item @var{nb-text3d-chars}
are integers giving the total number of characters in the 2D and 3D strings.

@item @var{time-step-values}
is a list of nb-time-steps double precision numbers giving the value of the
time (or any other variable) for which an evolution was saved.

@item @var{scalar-point-value}
@item @var{vector-point-value}

values associated with the nodes of the @var{nb-scalar-points} scalar
points, @var{nb-vector-points} vector points, @dots{}, for each of the
@var{time-step-values}.

For example, @var{vector-triangle-value} is defined as:

@end example

@item @var{text2d}
is a list of 4 double precision numbers:
@example
@var{coord1} @var{coord2} @var{style} @var{index}
@end example
where @var{coord1} and @var{coord2} give the coordinates of the leftmost
element of the 2D string in screen coordinates, @var{index} gives the
starting index of the string in @var{text2d-chars} and @var{style} is
currently unused.

@item @var{text2d-chars}
is a list of @item @var{nb-text2d-chars} characters. Substrings are
separated with the @code{^} characted (which is a forbidden character in
regular strings).

@item @var{text3d}
is a list of 5 double precision numbers
@example
@var{coord1} @var{coord2} @var{coord3} @var{style} @var{index}
@end example
where @var{coord1}, @var{coord2} and @var{coord3} give the coordinates of
the leftmost element of the 3D string in model (real world) coordinates,
@var{index} gives the starting index of the string in @var{text3d-chars} and
@var{style} is currently unused.

@item @var{text3d-chars}
is a list of @var{nb-text3d-chars} chars. Substrings are separated with the

@section Gmsh binary post-processing file format

@cindex Post-processing, binary file format
@cindex @file{.pos} file

The binary post-processing file format is the same as the ASCII file format
described in @ref{Gmsh ASCII post-processing file format}, except that:

@enumerate
@item
@var{file-type} equals 1.
@item 
all lists of floating point numbers and characters are written in binary
format
@item
there is an additional integer, of value 1, written before
time-step-values. This integer is used for detecting if the computer on
which the binary file was written and the computer on which the file is read
are of the same type (little or big endian).
@end enumerate

Here is a pseudo C code to write the beginning of a post-processing
file in binary format:

@example
int one = 1;

fprintf(file, "$PostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "%g %d %d\n", 1.2, 1, sizeof(double));
fprintf(file, "$EndPostFormat\n");
fprintf(file, "$View\n");
fprintf(file, "%s %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d "
  "%d %d %d %d\n",

  nb-scalar-quadrangles, nb-vector-quadrangles, nb-tensor-quadrangles,
  nb-scalar-tetrahedra, nb-vector-tetrahedra, nb-tensor-tetrahedra,
  nb-scalar-hexahedra, nb-vector-hexahedra, nb-tensor-hexahedra,
  nb-scalar-prisms, nb-vector-prisms, nb-tensor-prisms,
  nb-scalar-pyramids, nb-vector-pyramids, nb-tensor-pyramids,
  nb-text2d, nb-text2d-chars, nb-text3d, nb-text3d-chars);
fwrite(&one, sizeof(int), 1, file);
fwrite(time-step-values, sizeof(double), nb-time-steps, file);
fwrite(all-scalar-point-values, sizeof(double), ..., file);
...
fprintf(file, "\n$EndView\n");
@end example
In this pseudo-code, @var{all-scalar-point-values} is the array of double
precision numbers containing all the @var{scalar-point-value} lists, put one
after each other in order to form a long array of doubles. The principle is
the same for all other kinds of values.

@cindex Post-processing, parsed file format
@cindex @file{.pos} file

For relatively small data sets Gmsh provides an additional post-processing
format, which is parsed by the same grammar analyzer as the Gmsh script
language. You can thus, for example, embed small post-processing views
directly into your geometrical descriptions (see e.g. @ref{t4.geo}). This
format is also useful for testing purposes: its syntax is very permissive,
and you can easily generate it by hand or on the fly. The format of the
parsed post-processing file is the following:

@example
View "@var{string}" @{
  @var{type} ( @var{list-of-coords} ) @{ @var{list-of-values} @};
  @dots{}
@};
@end example

The same 26 base objects can be displayed as in the ASCII or binary
post-processing file formats:

@example
                    type  #list-of-coords #list-of-values

But, for historical rerasons, contrary to the ASCII and binary
post-processing file formats, the coordinates are given by node, i.e.:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{(coord1, coord2,coord3)} for a point,
@item 
@code{(coord1-node1, coord2-node1, coord3-node1,}@* 
@code{ coord1-node2, coord2-node2, coord3-node2)} for a line,
@item 
@code{(coord1-node1, coord2-node1, coord3-node1,}@*
@code{ coord1-node2, coord2-node2, coord3-node2,}@*
@code{ coord1-node3, coord2-node3, coord3-node3)} for a triangle,
@item
etc.
@end itemize
The values are given in the same order as for the ASCII and binary
post-processing file formats.

The analysis of the syntax is performed by Lex and Yacc.

The code itself is in C++ (but most of it was initially written in C, which
results in some hybrid code...).

All graphics are rendered using OpenGL.

The user interface is based on the FLTK widget set.

If you think you have found a bug in Gmsh, you can report it by electronic
mail to the Gmsh mailing list at @email{gmsh@@geuz.org}.  Please send as
precise a description of the problem as you can, including sample input
files that produce the bug (problem definition and mesh files). Don't forget
to mention both the version of Gmsh and the version of your operation
system (@pxref{Running Gmsh} to see how to get this information).

See the @file{TODO} file in the distribution to check the problems we
already know about.

Install the 'info' version of this user's guide! On your (Unix) system, this
can be achieved by 1) copying all gmsh.info* files to the place where your
info files live (usually /usr/info), and 2) issuing the command
'install-info /usr/info/gmsh.info /usr/info/dir'. You will then be able to
access the documentation with the command 'info gmsh'. Note that particular
sections ("nodes") can be accessed directly. For example, 'info gmsh
extrude' will take you directly to the definition of the Extrude command.
@item
Use emacs to edit your files, and load the C++ mode! This permits automatic
syntax highlighting and easy indentation. Automatic loading of the C++ mode
for @file{.pro} files can be achieved by adding the following command in
your @code{.emacs} file: @code{(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.pro$"
. c++-mode)) auto-mode-alist))}.
@item
Define common geometrical objects and options in separate files, reusable in
all your problem definition structures.
