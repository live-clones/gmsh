# Plugins (Tutorial 9)

Plugins are small standalone commands that extend Gmsh's default features.
In this tutorial, we'll look at some commonly used plugins:
- `Isosurface`
- `CutPlane`
- `Annotate`

The full list of plugins that are shipped with Gmsh by default is [here](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#Gmsh-plugins).
