# Size fields (Tutorial 10)

Size fields let you accurately specify mesh sizes over the entire mesh. Size fields
are one of the most important tools for meshing difficult geometries. You can combine
simple size fields to make a more complex size field. You can also provide an arbitrary
callback function to use as a size field.
