# Transformations (Tutorial 2)

Transform geometries using a number of operations, including: 
- translations
- rotations
- twists
- extrusions

At the end, this example also shows how to get an unrolled GEO file, which is a 
flat representation of the final geometry. 

### Python
```python
{{#include ../../../../tutorial/python/t2.py}}
```
