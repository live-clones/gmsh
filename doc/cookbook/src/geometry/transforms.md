# Transformations (Tutorial 2)

Transform geometries using a number of operations, including:
- translations
- rotations
- twists
- extrusions

At the end, this example also shows how to get an unrolled GEO file, which is a
flat representation of the final geometry.

### Python
```python
{{#include ../../../../tutorials/python/t2.py}}
```
