This is the binary Software Development Kit (SDK) for Gmsh ${GMSH_VERSION}:

  * Operating system: ${GMSH_OS} (${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME})
  * C++ compiler: ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}
  * C++ compiler ID: ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}
  * C++ compiler version: ${CXX_COMPILER_VERSION}
  * C++ compiler flags:${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO}
  * Build options:${GMSH_CONFIG_OPTIONS}

Gmsh is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License: see
share/doc/gmsh/LICENSE.txt and share/doc/gmsh/CREDITS.txt. For additional Gmsh
resources, see http://gmsh.info.

SDK layout:

  * lib/*gmsh*.{so,dll,dylib}: shared Gmsh library
  * lib/gmsh.lib: import library (Windows only)
  * lib/gmsh.py: Python module
  * lib/gmsh.jl: Julia module
  * include/gmsh.h: C++ API header
  * include/gmshc.h: C API header
  * include/gmsh.h_cwrap: C++ wrapper of the C API (see the `Notes' below)
  * bin/gmsh: gmsh executable (linked with the shared Gmsh library)
  * share/doc/gmsh/demos/api : API examples in C++, C, Python and Julia

Notes:

  * The C API (as well as the Python and Julia bindings, which use the C API
    internally) should work with most compilers.

  * The C++ API will only work if your compiler has the same Application Binary
    Interface (ABI) as the compiler used to build this SDK.

    For example, the Linux SDK is currently compiled with GCC 4. You would need
    to specify "-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" if you use GCC 5 or newer.

  * If your C++ compiler does not provide the same ABI as the C++ compiler used
    to build the SDK and if there are no compatibility flags available, you can
    rename `gmsh.h_cwrap' as `gmsh.h': this implementation redefines the C++ API
    in terms of the C API. Using this header will lead to (slightly) reduced
    performance compared to using the native Gmsh C++ API from the original
    `gmsh.h', as it entails additional data copies between this C++ wrapper, the
    C API and the native C++ code.

    For example, the Windows SDK is currently compiled using GCC 5. To compile a
    C++ example with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 in the Visual Studio shell and
    run it, you would do:

    C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk> ren include\gmsh.h_cwrap gmsh.h
    C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk> cl /Iinclude share\doc\gmsh\demos\api\simple.cpp lib\gmsh.lib
    C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk> cd lib
    C:\gmsh-git-Windows64-sdk\lib> ..\simple.exe
