New in 0.995: totally rewritten geometrical database (performance has
been drastically improved for all geometrical transformations, and
most notably for extrusion). As a consequence, the internal numbering
of geometrical entities has changed: this will cause incompatibilities
with old .geo files, and will require a partial rewrite of your old
.geo files if these files made use of geometrical transformations. The
syntax of the .geo file has also been clarified. Many additions for
scripting purposes. New extrusion mesh generator. Preliminary version
of the coupling between extruded and Delaunay meshes. New option and

boost of the 3D algorithm. Gmsh is still slow, but the performance
becomes acceptable. An average 1000 tetrahedra/second is obtained on a
600Mhz computer for a mesh of one million tetrahedra. New anisotropic
2D mesh algorithm. New (ASCII and binary) post-processing file format

(trackball mode). New didactic interactive mesh construction (watch
the Delaunay algorithm in real time on complex geometries: that's
exciting ;-). And many, many bug fixes and cleanings...

simple automatic animation of post-processing maps; fixed various bugs.

New in 0.991: fixed a serious allocation bug in 2D algorithm, which
caused random crashes. All users should upgrade to 0.991.

order mesh on non plane surfaces; added example 13.
