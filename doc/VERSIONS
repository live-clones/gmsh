Simplified options (suppression of option arrays).

New in 0.995: totally rewritten geometrical database (performance has
been drastically improved for all geometrical transformations, and
most notably for extrusion). As a consequence, the internal numbering
of geometrical entities has changed: this will cause incompatibilities
with old .geo files, and will require a partial rewrite of your old
.geo files if these files made use of geometrical transformations. The
syntax of the .geo file has also been clarified. Many additions for
scripting purposes. New extrusion mesh generator. Preliminary version
of the coupling between extruded and Delaunay meshes. New option and
procedural database. All interactive operations can be scripted in the
input files. See the last example in the tutorial for an example. Many
stability enhancements in the 2D and 3D mesh algorithms. Performance
boost of the 3D algorithm. Gmsh is still slow, but the performance
becomes acceptable. An average 1000 tetrahedra/second is obtained on a
600Mhz computer for a mesh of one million tetrahedra. New anisotropic
2D mesh algorithm. New (ASCII and binary) post-processing file format
and clarified mesh file format. New handling for interactive rotations
(trackball mode). New didactic interactive mesh construction (watch
the Delaunay algorithm in real time on complex geometries: that's
exciting ;-). And many, many bug fixes and cleanings...

New in 0.992: corrected recombined extrusion; corrected ellipses; added
simple automatic animation of post-processing maps; fixed various bugs.

New in 0.991: fixed a serious allocation bug in 2D algorithm, which
caused random crashes. All users should upgrade to 0.991.

New in 0.989: added ability to reload previously saved meshes; some
new command line options; reorganization of the scale menu; GIF
output.

generation of erroneous 3d meshes); corrected bug for mixed 3D meshes;
moved the 'toggle view link' option to Opt->Postprocessing_Options.

on 32 bits machines; fixed small 3d mesh bug.

New in 0.985: corrected colormap bug on HP, SUN, SGI and IBM versions;

order mesh on non plane surfaces; added example 13.
