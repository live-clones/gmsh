orientation of recombined quadrangles...); reorganized the interface
menus; added constrained background mesh and mesh visibility options;
added mesh quality histograms; changed default mesh colors;
reintegrated the old command-line extrusion mesh generator;

for recent versions of the opengl32.dll on Windows, which caused OpenGL
fonts not to show up;

New in 1.15: Added automatic visibility setting during entity
selection; Corrected geometrical extrusion bug;

New in 1.14: Corrected a few bugs in the GUI (most of them were
introduced in 1.13); Added interactive color selection; Made the
option database bidirectional (i.e. scripts now correctly update the
GUI); Default options can now be saved and automatically reloaded at
startup; Made some changes to the scripting syntax
(PostProcessing.View[n] becomes View[n]; Offset0 becomes OffsetX,
etc.); Corrected the handling of simple triangular surfaces with large
characteristic lengths in the 2D isotropic algorithm; Added an ascii
to binary post-processing view converter;

(dithering, transparency); Slightly changed the post-processing file
format to allow both single and double precision numbers.

New in 0.999: Added JPEG output and easy MPEG generation (see t8.geo in the
tutorial); Clean up of export functions; small fixes; Linux versions
are now compiled with gcc 2.95.2, which should fix the problems
encountered with Mandrake 7.2;

in 2D mesh when meshing in the mean plane; 

New in 0.996: Arrays of variables; Enhanced Printf and Sprintf;
Simplified options (suppression of option arrays).

New in 0.995: Totally rewritten geometrical database (performance has
been drastically improved for all geometrical transformations, and
most notably for extrusion). As a consequence, the internal numbering
of geometrical entities has changed: this will cause incompatibilities
with old .geo files, and will require a partial rewrite of your old
.geo files if these files made use of geometrical transformations. The
syntax of the .geo file has also been clarified. Many additions for
scripting purposes. New extrusion mesh generator. Preliminary version
of the coupling between extruded and Delaunay meshes. New option and
procedural database. All interactive operations can be scripted in the
input files. See the last example in the tutorial for an example. Many
stability enhancements in the 2D and 3D mesh algorithms. Performance
boost of the 3D algorithm. Gmsh is still slow, but the performance
becomes acceptable. An average 1000 tetrahedra/second is obtained on a
600Mhz computer for a mesh of one million tetrahedra. New anisotropic
2D mesh algorithm. New (ascii and binary) post-processing file format
and clarified mesh file format. New handling for interactive rotations
(trackball mode). New didactic interactive mesh construction (watch
the Delaunay algorithm in real time on complex geometries: that's
exciting ;-). And many, many bug fixes and cleanings...

New in 0.992: corrected recombined extrusion; corrected ellipses; added
simple automatic animation of post-processing maps; fixed various bugs.

New in 0.991: fixed a serious allocation bug in 2D algorithm, which
caused random crashes. All users should upgrade to 0.991.

New in 0.989: added ability to reload previously saved meshes; some
new command line options; reorganization of the scale menu; GIF

order mesh on non plane surfaces; added example 13.
