Special thanks to Bill Spitzak, Michael Sweet, Matthias Melcher, Greg Ercolano
and others for the Fast Light Tool Kit on which Gmsh's GUI is based. See
http://www.fltk.org for more info on this excellent object-oriented,
cross-platform toolkit. Special thanks also to EDF for funding the original
OpenCASCADE and MED integration in 2006-2007. Gmsh development was also
financially supported by the PRACE project funded in part by the EU's Horizon
2020 Research and Innovation programme (2014-2020) under grant agreement 823767.
