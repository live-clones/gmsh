# This shows how ONELAB clients that communicate with the ONELAB server through
# sockets can be executed using the Gmsh API, by explicitely specying the
# command to run the client

# One such example is the GetDP finite element solver (https://getdp.info).

# Provided that the getdp executable is in your path, running this example in
# the getdp/demos directory will launch two getdp clients concurrently, that
# will both exchange data with the ONELAB server
