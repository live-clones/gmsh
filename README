This is Gmsh, an automatic three-dimensional finite element mesh
generator, primarily Delaunay, with built-in pre- and post-processing
facilities.

Gmsh is free software. See the file COPYING for copying
permission. Parts of Gmsh are distributed with additional license
requirements. Check individual files for more information. Most
notably, if you incorporate the Triangle/ library, Gmsh can only be
redistributed if no compensation is received.

Type 'make' to build Gmsh. This requires FLTK version 1.1.x to be
installed in $(HOME)/SOURCES/fltk-1.1

See the doc/ and tutorial/ directories for documentation.

See the demos/ directory for additional examples.
